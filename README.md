# Marketing Agent Skills

AI agent skills for marketing tasks, built for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and similar AI coding assistants.

---

I'm [James](https://www.jamespraise.xyz), founder of [Marketing In Action](https://marketinginaction.xyz) and a Product & Growth Marketing consultant with close to a decade of startup experience. I've been a founding marketer multiple times, building marketing functions and systems from scratch.

I am currently experimenting with vibe coding, and this is one of the projects I'm building with that knowledge.

This repo is the Claude skills version of the [MIA Resources](https://marketinginaction.xyz/resources/) I have developed:

1. **Product Marketing Templates & Resources Library**: 50+ Product & Growth Marketing templates, frameworks, and resources to execute marketing with clarity.
2. **AI Prompt Frameworks & Templates for Marketers**: 50+ frameworks and templates that marketers and founders use to produce consistent, high-quality outputs from AI tools like ChatGPT Projects, Claude Projects, Gemini Gems, Custom GPTs & OpenAI Assistants.

These skills make it easier to unify and apply the knowledge and prompts from the knowledge files and custom GPTs/prompts.
