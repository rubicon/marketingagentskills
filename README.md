# Marketing Agent Skills

22 AI agent skills for marketing tasks, built for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and similar AI coding assistants (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code).

---

I'm [James](https://www.jamespraise.xyz), founder of [Marketing In Action](https://marketinginaction.xyz) and a Product & Growth Marketing consultant with close to a decade of startup experience. I've been a founding marketer multiple times, building marketing functions and systems from scratch.

This repo is the Claude skills version of the [MIA Resources](https://marketinginaction.xyz/resources/) I have developed (100+ marketing templates and AI prompt frameworks for execution and consistent high-quality outputs from AI tools like ChatGPT Projects, Claude Projects, Gemini Gems, Custom GPTs & OpenAI Assistants).

These skills make it easier to unify and apply the knowledge and prompts from the knowledge files and custom GPTs/prompts.

I am currently experimenting with vibe coding, and this is one of the projects I'm building with that knowledge. You can also check out the vibe-coded repo of the MIA website here: [github.com/realjaymes/marketinginaction](https://github.com/realjaymes/marketinginaction)

## What are Skills?
