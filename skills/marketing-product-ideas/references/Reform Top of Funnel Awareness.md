Typeform:
 
Viral
 
Form
 
Sharing
 
&
 
Design-Led
 
Brand
 
Awareness
 
Typeform’s
 
rise
 
was
 
fueled
 
by
 
virality
 
and
 
content
 
that
 
made
 
the
 
product
 
ubiquitous
 
among
 
marketers:
 
●
 
Viral
 
“Powered
 
By”
 
Loops
:
 
Early
 
Typeform
 
users
 
became
 
inadvertent
 
ambassadors.
 
Every
 
form
 
created
 
on
 
the
 
free
 
plan
 
was
 
hosted
 
on
 
a
 
Typeform
 
URL
 
and
 
included
 
a
 
“Powered
 
by
 
Typeform”
 
button
 
[1]
[2]
.
 
As
 
users
 
shared
 
Typeform-powered
 
surveys
 
and
 
quizzes
 
with
 
their
 
own
 
audiences,
 
this
 
exposed
 
new
 
people
 
to
 
the
 
product.
 
This
 
viral
 
loop
 
quickly
 
kicked
 
in
 
–
 
by
 
early
 
2014
 
Typeform
 
had
 
reached
 
~50,000
 
users,
 
largely
 
via
 
word-of-mouth
 
from
 
shared
 
forms
 
[1]
.
 
(Behavioral
 
principle:
 
Social
 
Proof
 
&
 
Network
 
Effects
 
–
 
seeing
 
“Powered
 
by
 
Typeform”
 
on
 
forms
 
signaled
 
a
 
popular
 
tool
 
and
 
invited
 
others
 
to
 
try
 
it.)
 
●
 
Frictionless
 
Sharing
 
&
 
Onboarding
:
 
Typeform
 
obsessively
 
reduced
 
signup
 
friction
 
to
 
maximize
 
the
 
above
 
loop.
 
They
 
even
 
A/B
 
tested
 
the
 
call-to-action
 
on
 
form
 
completion
 
pages,
 
finding
 
that
 
wording
 
like
 
“Create
 
your
 
own
 
Typeform”
 
drove
 
200%
 
more
 
new
 
user
 
sign-ups
 
than
 
a
 
generic
 
CTA
 
[3]
.
 
At
 
one
 
point,
 
they
 
let
 
new
 
users
 
start
 
building
 
a
 
form
 
without
 
creating
 
an
 
account,
 
lowering
 
the
 
psychological
 
barrier
 
to
 
trying
 
the
 
product
 
[3]
.
 
This
 
“give
 
value
 
first”
 
approach
 
meant
 
more
 
people
 
reached
 
an
 
“aha”
 
moment
 
and
 
willingly
 
signed
 
up
 
to
 
save
 
their
 
work
 
(Principle:
 
Reciprocity
 
–
 
offering
 
value
 
before
 
asking
 
for
 
info).
 
●
 
Template
 
Gallery
 
&
 
SEO
:
 
To
 
capture
 
long-tail
 
search
 
traffic,
 
Typeform
 
built
 
out
 
a
 
public
 
template
 
library
 
of
 
forms
 
and
 
surveys
 
[4]
.
 
Users
 
browsing
 
for,
 
say,
 
a
 
“customer
 
feedback
 
form
 
template”
 
could
 
find
 
Typeform’s
 
examples
 
via
 
Google
 
and
 
be
 
led
 
into
 
the
 
product.
 
These
 
templates
 
not
 
only
 
boosted
 
organic
 
traffic
 
(Principle:
 
Familiarity
 
–
 
showing
 
up
 
in
 
searches
 
frequently)
 
but
 
also
 
demonstrated
 
Typeform’s
 
capabilities
 
upfront
 
(Authority
 
in
 
form
 
design).
 
This
 
content
 
strategy
 
yielded
 
“significant
 
long-tail
 
SEO
 
juice”
 
for
 
Typeform
 
[4]
.
 
●
 
Content
 
Marketing
 
&
 
Social
 
Presence
:
 
Beyond
 
templates,
 
Typeform
 
invested
 
heavily
 
in
 
editorial
 
content
 
(blog
 
articles,
 
how-to
 
guides,
 
webinars)
 
and
 
an
 
active
 
social
 
media
 
presence
 
to
 
establish
 
itself
 
as
 
a
 
thought
 
leader
 
[5]
.
 
They
 
published
 
research-driven
 
posts
 
on
 
lead
 
generation,
 
interactive
 
design,
 
and
 
more,
 
which
 
attracted
 
marketers
 
searching
 
for
 
advice
 
[6]
[5]
.
 
By
 
providing
 
valuable
 
content,
 
Typeform
 
stayed
 
top-of-mind
 
(Principle:
 
Authority
 
–
 
being
 
seen
 
as
 
an
 
expert).
 
This
 
content
 
was
 
widely
 
shared
 
on
 
social
 
channels,
 
further
 
increasing
 
brand
 
awareness
 
(Principle:
 
Familiarity).
 
One
 
Typeform
 
marketing
 
exec
 
described
 
their
 
mantra
 
simply:
 
“Generate
 
brand
 
awareness
 
&
 
increase
 
sign
 
ups.”
 
[7]
 
●
 
Community
 
Launch
 
&
 
Partnerships
:
 
The
 
founders
 
primed
 
the
 
pump
 
by
 
launching
 
Typeform
 
in
 
startup
 
communities.
 
In
 
October
 
2012
 
they
 
released
 
a
 
teaser
 
video
 
on
 
BetaList,
 
a
 
site
 
for
 
upcoming
 
startups
 
–
 
it
 
went
 
viral
 
and
 
netted
 
the
 
first
 
1,000
 
beta
 
users
 
[8]
.
 
This
 
early
 
buzz
 
in
 
a
 
community
 
of
 
early
 
adopters
 
created
 
momentum
 
from
 
day
 
one
 
(Principle:
 
Scarcity/Novelty
 
–
 
an
 
invite-only
 
beta
 
on
 
BetaList
 
felt
 
exclusive
 
and
 
share-worthy).
 
As
 
the
 
product
 
matured,
 
Typeform
 
also
 
formed
 
partnerships
 
with
 
agencies
 
and
 
tech
 
companies
 
to
 
extend
 
reach
 
[9]
.
 
For
 
example,
 
marketing
 
agencies
 
began
 
using
 
Typeform
 
for
 
clients’
 
campaigns,
 
exposing
 
the
 
tool
 
to
 
new
 
business
 
audiences.
 
Integration
 
partnerships
 
(e.g.
 
being
 
listed
 
in
 
HubSpot’s
 
or
 
MailChimp’s
 
marketplaces)
 
likewise
 
let
 
Typeform
 
piggyback
 
on
 
more
 
established
 
platforms
 
(Principle:
 
Association
 
–
 
aligning
 
with
 
trusted
 
brands
 
transfers
 
credibility
 
to
 
Typeform).
 
Behavioral
 
principles
 
used:
 
Social
 
Proof,
 
Familiarity,
 
Simplicity,
 
Attention,
 
Commitment,
 
and
 
Compounding.
 
Typeform
 
demonstrates
 
how
 
embedding
 
branding
 
into
 
shared
 
artifacts
 
turns
 
everyday
 
usage
 
into
 
discovery.
 
By
 
making
 
forms
 
easy
 
to
 
share
 
and
 
visually
 
distinctive,

repeated
 
exposure
 
in
 
real

which
 
builds

and

Over
 
time,
 
seeing
 
Typeform
 
repeatedly
 
in
 
use
 
reduces
 
perceived
 
risk
 
and
 
anchors
 
it
 
as
 
the

tool.
 
 
Jotform:
 
Community
 
Seeding
 
&
 
Product-as-Distribution
 
Jotform
 
(founded
 
2006)
 
grew
 
“quietly”
 
by
 
seeding
 
its
 
target
 
user
 
communities
 
and
 
making
 
the
 
product
 
incredibly
 
easy
 
to
 
adopt
 
–
 
a
 
strategy
 
that
 
paid
 
off
 
in
 
the
 
pre-social-media
 
era:
 
 
Jotform’s
 
early
 
growth
 
loop
 
harnessed
 
community
 
and
 
product
 
virality.
 
The
 
team
 
first
 
promoted
 
Jotform
 
in
 
tech
 
blogs
 
and
 
forums
 
(“Outreach
 
Tech
 
Community”),
 
then
 
made
 
their
 
homepage
 
the
 
actual
 
form
 
builder
 
so
 
anyone
 
could
 
use
 
it
 
instantly.
 
Users
 
who
 
created
 
forms
 
would
 
share
 
them
 
with
 
their
 
audiences,
 
giving
 
Jotform
 
free
 
exposure
 
to
 
new
 
prospects.
 
This
 
self-reinforcing
 
cycle
 
drove
 
continuous
 
organic
 
signups
 
[10]
[11]
.
 
●
 
Community
 
Seeding
 
via
 
Blogs/Forums
:
 
Jotform’s
 
founder
 
Aytekin
 
Tank
 
tapped
 
into
 
the
 
“blogosphere”
 
of
 
the
 
mid-2000s
 
and
 
tech
 
forums
 
where
 
web
 
designers
 
and
 
developers
 
congregated
 
[12]
[13]
.
 
He
 
announced
 
and
 
discussed
 
Jotform
 
on
 
influential
 
sites
 
like
 
Business
 
of
 
Software
 
and
 
engaged
 
with
 
peer
 
bloggers
 
to
 
have
 
them
 
cover
 
the
 
product’s
 
launch
 
[12]
[14]
.
 
This
 
was
 
essentially
 
the
 
2006
 
equivalent
 
of
 
going
 
viral
 
on
 
Twitter:
 
“getting
 
covered
 
in
 
blogs
 
meant
 
back
 
then
 
what
 
going
 
viral
 
on
 
social
 
media
 
is
 
today,”
 
as
 
one
 
analysis
 
noted
 
[15]
.
 
These
 
third-party
 
blog
 
posts
 
lent
 
authority
 
and
 
credibility
 
to
 
Jotform
 
(early
 
social
 
proof
 
from
 
respected
 
voices),
 
attracting
 
early
 
adopters
 
in
 
the
 
web
 
design
 
community.

“Product
 
as
 
Homepage”
 
–
 
Instant
 
Trial
:
 
In
 
a
 
bold
 
move,
 
Jotform’s
 
home
 
page
 
was
 
literally
 
the
 
app
 
itself
 
for
 
its
 
first
 
5
 
years
 
[16]
[17]
.
 
When
 
a
 
visitor
 
landed
 
on
 
jotform.com
 
in
 
2006,
 
they
 
saw
 
a
 
live
 
form
 
builder
 
canvas
 
(with
 
drag-and-drop
 
fields)
 
and
 
could
 
start
 
building
 
a
 
form
 
immediately,
 
no
 
signup
 
or
 
download
 
required
 
[16]
.
 
This
 
radical
 
reduction
 
of
 
friction
 
showed
 
huge
 
respect
 
for
 
users’
 
time
 
(Principle:
 
Simplicity).
 
As
 
Aytekin
 
explained,
 
“They
 
just
 
met
 
you
 
–
 
why
 
should
 
they
 
invest
 
time
 
filling
 
a
 
sign-up
 
form
 
first?”
 
By
 
letting
 
webmasters
 
play
 
with
 
Jotform
 
in
 
seconds,
 
it
 
hooked
 
them
 
on
 
the
 
value
 
before
 
any
 
commitment
 
(Principle:
 
Reciprocity
 
and
 
Instant

In

differentiated
 
Jotform
 
as
 
an
 
innovative,
 
developer-friendly
 
tool
 
(it
 
was
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
first
 
ever
 
WYSIWYG
 
form
 
builders
 
[18]
).
 
●
 
Freemium
 
Model
 
&
 
Generous
 
Usage
:
 
Jotform
 
launched
 
completely
 
free
 
for
 
its
 
first
 
year,
 
removing
 
the
 
cost
 
barrier
 
for
 
adoption
 
[19]
.
 
Even
 
after
 
introducing
 
paid
 
plans
 
in
 
2007,
 
a
 
free
 
tier
 
remained
 
(and
 
still
 
exists
 
today)
 
[20]
.
 
This
 
freemium
 
approach
 
encouraged
 
users
 
to
 
try
 
and
 
share
 
the
 
product
 
widely
 
without
 
hesitation
 
(Principle:
 
Loss
 
Aversion
 
minimized
 
–
 
nothing
 
to
 
lose
 
by
 
trying
 
it).
 
Users
 
could
 
recommend
 
Jotform
 
to
 
peers
 
knowing
 
cost
 
wasn’t
 
an
 
issue.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
much
 
of
 
Jotform’s
 
early
 
growth
 
was
 
customer-funded
 
via
 
word-of-mouth
 
rather
 
than
 
paid
 
marketing.
 
Only
 
after
 
years
 
of
 
steady
 
user
 
growth
 
did
 
monetization
 
kick
 
in
 
–
 
by
 
then
 
the
 
top-of-funnel
 
was
 
massive
 
and
 
fueled
 
by
 
goodwill
 
from
 
the
 
free
 
tool.
 
●
 
Built-In
 
Virality
 
through
 
Sharing
:
 
Every
 
form
 
created
 
on
 
Jotform
 
had
 
its
 
own
 
shareable
 
URL
 
(on
 
Jotform’s
 
domain)
 
and
 
embed
 
code
 
[10]
.
 
Users
 
often
 
built
 
contact
 
forms,
 
survey
 
forms,
 
event
 
registrations,
 
etc.,
 
and
 
then
 
shared
 
those
 
form
 
links
 
with
 
their
 
audiences
 
or
 
clients.
 
In
 
doing
 
so,
 
they
 
were
 
also
 
spreading
 
awareness
 
of
 
Jotform
 
to
 
each
 
person
 
who
 
opened
 
the
 
form
 
[11]
.
 
The
 
viral
 
effect
 
was
 
subtle
 
but
 
powerful:
 
someone
 
filling
 
out
 
a
 
Jotform
 
would
 
see
 
the
 
branding
 
or
 
URL
 
and
 
realize
 
a
 
new
 
tool
 
made
 
this
 
form.
 
Many
 
of
 
Jotform’s
 
new
 
users
 
discovered
 
it
 
by
 
initially
 
being
 
form
 
respondents.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
same
 
network
 
effect
 
Typeform
 
later
 
harnessed.
 
Jotform
 
further
 
encouraged
 
sharing
 
by
 
not
 
imposing
 
strict
 
limits
 
early
 
on
 
–
 
users
 
weren’t
 
afraid
 
to
 
have
 
their
 
forms
 
go
 
viral
 
since
 
the
 
free
 
tier
 
was
 
generous.
 
(Principle:
 
Social
 
Proof/FOMO
 
–
 
seeing
 
a
 
Jotform
 
link
 
in
 
circulation
 
made
 
others
 
curious
 
to
 
check
 
out
 
what
 
it
 
was.)
 
●
 
Slow-Burn
 
Content
 
&
 
SEO
:
 
Although
 
Jotform’s
 
early
 
days
 
predated
 
modern
 
content
 
marketing,
 
Aytekin
 
maintained
 
a
 
blog
 
and
 
actively
 
participated
 
in
 
discussions
 
around
 
form
 
design
 
and
 
web
 
app
 
development.
 
Over
 
time,
 
Jotform
 
amassed
 
a
 
wealth
 
of
 
user-generated
 
forum
 
Q&As,
 
tutorial
 
pages,
 
and
 
template
 
examples
 
that
 
began
 
ranking
 
in
 
search
 
engines.
 
This
 
long-term
 
investment
 
in
 
content
 
paid
 
dividends
 
much
 
later
 
as
 
SEO
 
traffic
 
(“blog
 
search
 
engines
 
like
 
Technorati
 
were
 
a
 
thing”
 
in
 
2006
 
[21]
).
 
In
 
essence,
 
helpful
 
content
 
and
 
conversations
 
planted
 
seeds
 
of
 
awareness
 
that
 
kept
 
sprouting
 
new
 
users
 
year
 
after
 
year
 
(Authority
 
and
 
Familiarity
 
effects
 
as
 
Jotform
 
became
 
a
 
known
 
name
 
in
 
its
 
niche).
 
Behavioral
 
principles
 
used:
 
Simplicity,
 
Reciprocity,
 
Familiarity,
 
Social
 
Proof,
 
and
 
Compounding.
 
Jotform
 
shows
 
how
 
removing
 
friction
 
entirely
 
and
 
giving
 
away
 
real
 
utility
 
encourages
 
widespread
 
adoption
 
and
 
sharing.
 
By
 
letting
 
users
 
experience
 
value
 
instantly
 
and
 
without
 
cost,
 
Jotform
 
earned
 
goodwill
 
and
 
habitual
 
use.
 
Repeated
 
exposure
 
through
 
shared
 
forms
 
and
 
community
 
discussions
 
compounded
 
awareness
 
long
 
before
 
aggressive
 
monetization
 
was
 
introduced.
 
 
Paperform:
 
Deal-Led
 
Discovery
 
&
 
Niche
 
Template
 
SEO
 
Paperform
 
(launched
 
2016)
 
is
 
a
 
newer
 
form
 
builder
 
that
 
had
 
to
 
scrap
 
its
 
way
 
into
 
awareness
 
against
 
much
 
larger
 
incumbents.
 
They
 
did
 
so
 
through
 
deal
 
marketplaces
 
and
 
grassroots
 
content
 
efforts:
 
●
 
Deal
 
Marketplace
 
Launch
 
(AppSumo)
:
 
Lacking
 
a
 
big
 
marketing
 
budget,
 
Paperform
 
turned
 
to
 
AppSumo,
 
a
 
daily
 
deals
 
site
 
popular
 
with
 
entrepreneurs,
 
to
 
rapidly
 
grow
 
its
 
user
 
base.
 
In
 
2017,
 
shortly
 
after
 
launching,
 
Paperform
 
offered
 
a
 
lifetime
 
license
 
on
 
AppSumo
 
for
 
a
 
low
 
one-time
 
price.
 
The
 
result:
 
about
 
3,000
 
new
 
customers
 
in
 
a
 
matter
 
of
 
weeks
 
[51]
[52]
.
 
This
 
influx
 
didn’t
 
immediately
 
translate
 
to
 
recurring
 
revenue
 
(since
 
the
 
deal
 
was
 
a
 
one-time
 
purchase),
 
but
 
it
 
achieved
 
a
 
critical
 
goal:
 
getting
 
thousands
 
of
 
people
 
using
 
and
 
talking
 
about
 
Paperform.
 
Those
 
users
 
became
 
a
 
source
 
of
 
reviews,
 
word-of-mouth,
 
and
 
community
 
presence
 
that
 
put
 
Paperform
 
on
 
the
 
map.
 
The
 
revenue
 
from
 
the
 
deal
 
also
 
funded
 
the
 
team’s
 
further
 
product
 
development

(Principle:
 
Scarcity
 
&
 
Social
 
Proof
 
–
 
the
 
time-limited
 
deal
 
created
 
urgency
 
and
 
the
 
sheer
 
number
 
of
 
buyers
 
created
 
buzz
 
in
 
startup
 
circles,
 
making
 
others
 
curious
 
about
 
“the
 
form
 
tool
 
3,000
 
people
 
just
 
grabbed”.)
 
This
 
tactic
 
traded
 
short-term
 
profit
 
for
 
long-term
 
awareness,
 
a
 
smart
 
move
 
for
 
a
 
newcomer
 
fighting
 
for
 
attention.
 
●
 
BetaList
 
&
 
Early
 
Adopter
 
Community
:
 
Prior
 
to
 
AppSumo,
 
Paperform’s
 
founder
 
Dean
 
McPherson
 
tried
 
drumming
 
up
 
interest
 
via
 
BetaList,
 
similar
 
to
 
Typeform’s
 
approach
 
[53]
.
 
The
 
BetaList
 
feature
 
itself
 
only
 
drove
 
a
 
trickle
 
of
 
signups
 
(it
 
was
 
tough
 
by
 
2016
 
to
 
stand
 
out
 
on
 
that
 
platform),
 
but
 
it
 
had
 
an
 
indirect
 
payoff:
 
the
 
AppSumo
 
team
 
discovered
 
Paperform
 
through
 
that
 
BetaList
 
posting
 
and
 
reached
 
out
 
to
 
include
 
them
 
in
 
a
 
deal
 
[51]
.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
great
 
example
 
of
 
why
 
planting
 
seeds
 
in
 
various
 
startup
 
communities
 
can
 
be
 
worthwhile
 
even
 
if
 
immediate
 
results
 
seem
 
small
 
–
 
you
 
never
 
know
 
who’s
 
lurking.
 
After
 
the
 
AppSumo
 
surge,
 
those
 
initial
 
users
 
left
 
early
 
reviews
 
on
 
blogs
 
and
 
mentioned
 
Paperform
 
in
 
forums
 
like
 
Product
 
Hunt
 
and
 
Reddit,
 
creating
 
a
 
foundational
 
layer
 
of
 
awareness
 
among
 
tech-savvy
 
users.
 
(Principle:
 
Serendipity
 
&
 
Proof
 
–
 
being
 
present
 
in
 
the
 
right
 
place
 
made
 
a
 
lucky
 
break
 
possible,
 
and
 
those
 
early
 
adopters’
 
public
 
feedback
 
served
 
as
 
social
 
proof
 
to
 
future
 
evaluators.)
 
●
 
Integration
 
Partnerships
 
and
 
Marketplaces
:
 
Like
 
others
 
in
 
this
 
space,
 
Paperform
 
recognized
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
integrating
 
with
 
popular
 
tools
 
to
 
piggyback
 
on
 
their
 
audiences.
 
They
 
built
 
deep
 
integrations
 
with
 
Zapier,
 
Google
 
Sheets,
 
Slack,
 
Mailchimp,
 
etc.,
 
and
 
got
 
listed
 
in
 
those
 
tools’
 
directories.
 
Notably,
 
Zapier
 
(the
 
automation
 
platform)
 
became
 
a
 
key
 
channel
 
–
 
Paperform
 
partnered
 
on
 
content
 
with
 
Zapier’s
 
team
 
and
 
appeared
 
in
 
Zapier’s
 
blog
 
as
 
a
 
recommended
 
form
 
solution
 
[54]
.
 
If
 
someone
 
searched
 
Zapier’s
 
site
 
for
 
“forms”
 
or
 
browsed
 
their
 
app
 
directory,
 
they’d
 
encounter
 
Paperform
 
alongside
 
bigger
 
names.
 
This
 
lent
 
Paperform
 
credibility
 
beyond
 
its
 
size.
 
It
 
also
 
tapped
 
into
 
ecosystem
 
SEO:
 
Zapier’s
 
own
 
high-domain
 
pages
 
featuring
 
Paperform
 
would
 
rank
 
well
 
on
 
Google
 
(e.g.
 
“Paperform
 
integrations
 
for
 
marketers”).
 
Similarly,
 
Paperform
 
actively
 
collected
 
reviews
 
on
 
Capterra/G2
 
and
 
leveraged
 
the
 
quotes
 
as
 
testimonials,
 
knowing
 
that
 
strong
 
ratings
 
on
 
software
 
comparison
 
sites
 
can
 
sway
 
organic
 
prospects.
 
(Principle:
 
Authority
 
by
 
Association
 
&
 
Social
 
Proof
 
–
 
being
 
seen
 
next
 
to
 
well-known
 
apps
 
with
 
5-star
 
reviews
 
signals
 
“trusted
 
solution”.)
 
●
 
Content
 
Marketing
 
for
 
Niches
:
 
With
 
a
 
lean
 
team,
 
Paperform
 
opted
 
for
 
very
 
targeted
 
content
 
to
 
drive
 
organic
 
awareness.
 
They
 
identified
 
niches
 
of
 
small
 
businesses
 
and
 
startups
 
that
 
could
 
benefit
 
from
 
smarter
 
forms
 
(e.g.
 
real
 
estate
 
agencies,
 
fitness
 
instructors,
 
nonprofits)
 
and
 
created
 
blog
 
posts
 
and
 
templates
 
tailored
 
to
 
those
 
verticals.
 
For
 
example,
 
their
 
blog
 
features
 
articles
 
like
 
“10
 
Digital
 
Marketing
 
Ideas
 
for
 
Real
 
Estate”
 
and
 
showcases
 
how
 
forms
 
can
 
help
 
capture
 
leads
 
in
 
that
 
industry
 
[55]
.
 
By
 
addressing
 
specific
 
use-cases,
 
Paperform
 
could
 
rank
 
for
 
long-tail
 
keywords
 
(like
 
“online
 
waiver
 
form
 
for
 
fitness
 
trainers”)
 
where
 
there
 
was
 
less
 
competition.
 
They
 
also
 
published
 
comparison
 
articles
 
(e.g.
 
“Typeform
 
vs
 
Google
 
Forms
 
vs
 
Paperform”)
 
to
 
capture
 
high-intent
 
researchers
 
looking
 
for
 
alternatives.
 
Over
 
time,
 
this
 
scrappy
 
SEO
 
strategy
 
brought
 
in
 
a
 
steady
 
flow
 
of
 
signups
 
who
 
found
 
Paperform
 
via
 
a
 
very
 
specific
 
query.
 
The
 
template
 
gallery
 
on
 
Paperform’s
 
site
 
likewise
 
caters
 
to
 
many
 
micro
 
use-cases
 
(client
 
onboarding
 
forms,
 
wedding
 
RSVP
 
forms,
 
etc.),
 
each
 
serving
 
as
 
a
 
potential
 
entry
 
point
 
for
 
a
 
niche
 
user
 
searching
 
that
 
term.
 
This
 
mirrors
 
the
 
template-driven
 
SEO
 
of
 
larger
 
rivals,
 
executed
 
on
 
a
 
smaller
 
scale.
 
(Principle:
 
Familiarity
 
–
 
by
 
appearing
 
in
 
answers
 
to
 
very
 
particular
 
problems,
 
Paperform
 
became
 
familiar
 
to
 
users
 
as
 
“the
 
solution
 
for
 
my
 
scenario”.)
 
●
 
Customer
 
Community
 
&
 
Advocacy
:
 
Paperform
 
has
 
cultivated
 
a
 
friendly
 
rapport
 
with
 
its
 
user
 
base,
 
many
 
of
 
whom
 
are
 
solo
 
entrepreneurs
 
or
 
small
 
teams
 
like
 
the
 
founders
 
themselves.
 
They
 
encourage
 
users
 
to
 
share
 
their
 
success
 
stories
 
and
 
form
 
designs
 
in
 
forums
 
and
 
on
 
social
 
media.
 
The
 
company
 
often
 
spotlights
 
these
 
user
 
stories
 
in
 
its
 
newsletter
 
and
 
blog,
 
giving
 
those
 
customers
 
a
 
moment
 
in
 
the
 
sun.
 
This
 
not
 
only
 
retains
 
existing
 
users
 
(who
 
feel
 
appreciated)
 
but
 
also
 
creates
 
authentic
 
advocates
 
who
 
bring
 
in
 
others.
 
For
 
instance,
 
a
 
marketing
 
consultant
 
impressed
 
by
 
Paperform
 
might
 
mention
 
it
 
in
 
a

By
 
being
 
very
 
responsive
 
in
 
support
 
and
 
on
 
social

the
 
Paperform

into

who
 
would
 
respond
 
to
 
“What

threads
 
with
 
an

how
 
concentrated
 
bursts
 
of
 
exposure
 
through
 
deal
 
platforms
 
and
 
targeted
 
niches
 
can
 
jumpstart
 
awareness.
 
Limited-time
 
deals
 
created
 
urgency
 
and
 
visibility,
 
while
 
niche
 
templates
 
and

reinforced
 
relevance.
 
As
 
users
 
saw
 
peers
 
adopting
 
Paperform
 
in
 
specific

Content
 
Before
 
Product
 
(“Blogging
 
a
 
Year
 
Early”)
:
 
Unbounce
 
prioritized
 
building
 
an
 
audience
 
even
 
before
 
the
 
product
 
was
 
fully
 
launched.
 
Co-founder
 
Rick
 
Perreault
 
hired
 
a
 
blogger
 
as
 
the
 
first
 
employee
 
and
 
started
 
the
 
Unbounce
 
marketing
 
blog
 
in
 
2009,
 
roughly
 
a
 
year
 
prior
 
to
 
their
 
product
 
release
 
[40]
[39]
.
 
They
 
published
 
high-quality
 
articles
 
about
 
landing
 
page
 
optimization,
 
A/B
 
testing,
 
and
 
conversion
 
rate
 
tactics
 
–
 
effectively
 
teaching
 
their
 
target
 
audience
 
(digital
 
marketers)
 
for
 
free.
 
By
 
the
 
time
 
Unbounce
 
actually
 
launched
 
in
 
mid-2010,
 
their
 
blog
 
was
 
already
 
getting
 
~20,000
 
monthly
 
visitors
 
and
 
had
 
an
 
email
 
list
 
of
 
5,000
 
subscribers
 
waiting
 
[41]
[42]
!
 
This
 
meant
 
instant
 
awareness
 
and
 
traffic
 
for
 
the
 
product
 
without
 
a
 
big
 
ad
 
spend.
 
Crucially,
 
the
 
content
 
wasn’t
 
shallow
 
SEO
 
bait;
 
it
 
provided
 
real
 
value,
 
which
 
built
 
Unbounce’s
 
reputation
 
as
 
an
 
authority
 
in
 
digital
 
marketing.
 
Marketers
 
who
 
learned
 
from
 
Unbounce’s
 
blog
 
viewed
 
the
 
company
 
as
 
a
 
trusted
 
expert
 
long
 
before
 
they
 
became
 
a
 
software
 
vendor
 
(Principle:

&
 
Reciprocity

●
 
Evergreen,
 
Share-Worthy
 
Content
:
 
The
 
Unbounce
 
team
 
excelled
 
at
 
creating
 
viral-worthy
 
content
 
in
 
the
 
marketing
 
space.
 
A
 
standout
 
example
 
was
 
their
 
“Noob
 
Guide
 
to
 
Online
 
Marketing”
 
–
 
a
 
massive
 
infographic
 
and
 
blog
 
post
 
that
 
covered
 
a
 
6-month
 
marketing
 
plan
 
in
 
exquisite
 
detail.
 
This
 
piece
 
alone
 
drove
 
“tens
 
of
 
thousands
 
of
 
paying
 
customers”
 
over
 
time
 
and
 
was
 
shared
 
on
 
Twitter
 
roughly
 
once
 
per
 
hour
 
for
 
an
 
entire
 
year
 
after
 
publication
 
[43]
[44]
.
 
It
 
got
 
picked
 
up
 
by
 
countless
 
other
 
blogs
 
and
 
even
 
print
 
publications.
 
The
 
success
 
of
 
this
 
and
 
similar
 
content
 
proved
 
a
 
key
 
point:
 
content
 
has
 
compounding
 
returns.
 
As
 
Rick
 
noted,
 
“Something
 
we
 
wrote
 
in
 
January
 
2010
 
still
 
drives
 
customers
 
today…
 
If
 
I
 
had
 
spent
 
that
 
money
 
on
 
ads,
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
gone.”
 
[39]
[45]
 
Unbounce
 
leveraged
 
the
 
Principle
 
of
 
Consistency
 
–
 
by
 
consistently
 
putting
 
out
 
valuable
 
content,
 
they
 
became
 
a
 
fixture
 
in
 
marketers’
 
minds
 
(and
 
in
 
Google
 
results)
 
whenever
 
“landing
 
pages”
 
or
 
“conversion
 
tips”
 
were
 
discussed.
 
Each
 
big
 
content
 
hit
 
was
 
also
 
a
 
PR
 
opportunity
 
(e.g.
 
their
 
data-rich
 
posts
 
got
 
them
 
speaking
 
slots
 
at
 
conferences,
 
further
 
spreading
 
awareness
 
[46]
).

Social
 
Media
 
Amplification
:
 
In
 
the
 
early
 
days,
 
Unbounce
 
didn’t
 
just
 
publish
 
content
 
–
 
they
 
actively
 
promoted
 
it
 
on
 
social
 
channels
 
and
 
forums
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
snowball
 
rolling.
 
The
 
team
 
would
 
“ping
 
Twitter
 
influencers
 
asking
 
for
 
feedback”
 
on
 
new
 
blog
 
posts
 
and
 
engage
 
in
 
conversations
 
on
 
platforms
 
like
 
Quora
 
and
 
inbound
 
marketing
 
communities
 
[42]
.

(tweeting
 
at

sharing

a
 
wider
 
audience
 
and
 
lent
 
it
 
extra
 
credibility
 
(if
 
an
 
industry
 
expert
 
retweeted
 
an
 
Unbounce
 
article,
 
thousands
 
of
 
their
 
followers
 
would
 
see
 
it
 
–
 
classic
 
social
 
proof).
 
Claire
 
Suellentrop,
 
a
 
former
 
Growth
 
lead
 
at
 
Unbounce,
 
noted
 
that
 
“word
 
of
 
mouth
 
is
 
such
 
a
 
big
 
way
 
that
 
we
 
get
 
business,
 
so
 
Facebook
 
and
 
digital
 
communities
 
are
 
extremely
 
important
 
for
 
us.”
 
[47]
.
 
By
 
being
 
genuinely
 
helpful
 
and
 
not
 
overly
 
salesy,
 
the
 
Unbounce
 
team
 
earned
 
shout-outs
 
from
 
marketing
 
influencers,
 
essentially
 
turning
 
them
 
into
 
informal
 
brand
 
ambassadors.

Email
 
List
 
&
 
Drip
 
Education
:
 
Unbounce’s
 
blog
 
calls-to-action
 
often
 
invited
 
readers
 
to
 
subscribe
 
for
 
more
 
tips
 
or
 
download
 
exclusive
 
content.
 
This
 
grew
 
a
 
hefty
 
email
 
list
 
of
 
engaged
 
marketers
 
(5k+
 
before
 
launch,
 
and
 
multiplying
 
thereafter)
 
[48]
.
 
Via
 
this
 
channel,
 
Unbounce
 
could
 
continually
 
nurture
 
prospects
 
with
 
weekly
 
newsletters,
 
new
 
case
 
studies,
 
and
 
“insider”
 
content.
 
Over
 
time,
 
many
 
of
 
these
 
subscribers
 
converted
 
to
 
users
 
when
 
they
 
had
 
a
 
need
 
for
 
landing
 
page
 
software.
 
The
 
email
 
marketing
 
kept
 
Unbounce’s
 
brand
 
in
 
front
 
of
 
people
 
in
 
a
 
personalized
 
way
 
(Principle:
 
Familiarity
 
–
 
regular
 
helpful
 
emails
 
built
 
a
 
relationship).
 
Plus,
 
the
 
act
 
of
 
subscribing
 
itself
 
was
 
a
 
micro-commitment
 
from
 
the
 
audience,
 
making
 
them
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
try
 
the
 
product
 
down
 
the
 
road
 
(Principle:
 
Commitment).
 
Unbounce
 
treated
 
each
 
blog
 
post
 
as
 
a
 
full-fledged
 
campaign
 
–
 
promoting
 
it
 
on
 
social,
 
via
 
email,
 
and
 
even
 
with
 
the
 
occasional
 
paid
 
boost
 
–
 
to
 
ensure
 
their
 
content
 
investment
 
paid
 
off
 
in
 
maximum
 
awareness
 
[49]
.
 
●
 
Thought
 
Leadership
 
&
 
Social
 
Proof
:
 
By
 
consistently
 
blogging
 
and
 
publishing
 
original
 
research
 
(like
 
aggregate
 
conversion
 
benchmarks),
 
Unbounce’s
 
founders
 
and
 
team
 
became
 
thought
 
leaders
 
in
 
the
 
conversion
 
optimization
 
space.
 
This
 
led
 
to
 
speaking
 
opportunities
 
at
 
major
 
marketing
 
events
 
and
 
guest
 
writing
 
on
 
popular
 
marketing
 
sites,
 
which
 
in
 
turn
 
drove
 
more
 
awareness.
 
They
 
also
 
smartly
 
highlighted
 
logos
 
of
 
early
 
adopter
 
clients
 
and
 
testimonials
 
in
 
their
 
marketing,
 
reinforcing
 
that
 
real
 
companies
 
trust
 
Unbounce.
 
As
 
their
 
brand
 
grew,
 
they
 
secured
 
integration
 
partnerships
 
with
 
big
 
players
 
(e.g.
 
a
 
Salesforce
 
integration
 
[50]
)
 
and
 
didn’t
 
hesitate
 
to
 
announce
 
those.
 
Simply
 
mentioning
 
a
 
Salesforce
 
hookup
 
in
 
their
 
content
 
or
 
webinars
 
signaled
 
to
 
new
 
prospects
 
that
 
if
 
Salesforce
 
works
 
with
 
Unbounce,
 
maybe
 
we
 
should
 
too
 
(Principle:
 
Authority
 
by
 
Association).
 
All
 
of
 
these
 
factors
 
combined
 
meant
 
that
 
by
 
the
 
time
 
Unbounce
 
engaged
 
in
 
any
 
significant
 
paid
 
advertising,
 
they
 
already
 
had
 
a
 
globally
 
recognized
 
name
 
in
 
marketing
 
circles
 
–
 
earned
 
purely
 
through
 
content
 
and
 
community.
 
Behavioral
 
principles
 
used:
 
Authority,
 
Reciprocity,
 
Attention,
 
Familiarity,
 
Proof

Promise,
 
and
 
Compounding.
 
Unbounce
 
proves
 
that
 
teaching
 
the
 
market
 
before
 
selling
 
to
 
it
 
builds
 
durable
 
awareness.
 
By
 
publishing
 
high-quality
 
educational
 
content
 
long
 
before
 
product
 
launch,
 
Unbounce
 
earned
 
trust
 
and
 
mindshare.
 
Consistent
 
exposure
 
through
 
valuable
 
insights
 
created
 
familiarity,
 
while
 
real
 
examples
 
and
 
benchmarks
 
positioned
 
the
 
brand
 
as
 
the
 
authority
 
in
 
conversion
 
optimization.
 
 
Outfunnel:
 
Integration
 
SEO

Ecosystem-First
 
Distribution
 
Outfunnel
 
(a
 
B2B
 
tool
 
connecting
 
sales
 
and
 
marketing
 
data)
 
used
 
highly
 
targeted
 
organic
 
tactics
 
to
 
find
 
its
 
niche
 
audience
 
and
 
leverage
 
existing
 
platforms:
 
●
 
Piggybacking
 
on
 
an
 
Existing
 
Ecosystem
:
 
Outfunnel’s
 
initial
 
focus
 
was
 
integrating
 
marketing
 
automation
 
with
 
the
 
CRM
 
Pipedrive.
 
They
 
listed
 
early
 
on
 
the
 
Pipedrive
 
App
 
Marketplace
 
–
 
where
 
their
 
exact
 
target
 
users
 
(small
 
business
 
sales
 
teams)
 
browse
 
for
 
add-ons.
 
This
 
placement
 
became
 
“our
 
most
 
rewarding
 
channel
 
to
 
date”
 
according
 
to
 
Outfunnel’s
 
team
 
[22]
.
 
By
 
optimizing
 
their
 
Pipedrive
 
marketplace
 
profile
 
and
 
amassing
 
positive
 
reviews
 
there,
 
Outfunnel
 
gained
 
trust
 
and
 
visibility
 
among
 
Pipedrive’s
 
customer
 
base
 
[22]
.
 
(Principle:
 
Association
 
&
 
Social
 
Proof
 
–
 
being
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
top-rated
 
apps
 
in
 
a

Similarly,
 
they
 
integrated
 
with
 
HubSpot
 
and
 
other
 
CRMs,
 
ensuring
 
presence
 
wherever
 
their
 
ideal
 
users
 
might
 
look
 
for
 
solutions.
 
●
 
Integration
 
SEO
 
(“Search
 
First,
 
Build
 
Later”)
:
 
In
 
a
 
growth
 
hack,
 
Outfunnel’s
 
marketing
 
lead
 
Katheriin
 
Liibert
 
created
 
200+
 
landing
 
pages
 
for
 
integration
 
use-cases
 
that
 
didn’t
 
even
 
exist
 
yet
 
[23]
[24]
.
 
For
 
example,
 
a
 
page
 
titled
 
“Mailchimp
 
✕
 
Salesforce
 
Integration”
 
might
 
be
 
published
 
to
 
capture
 
searchers
 
looking
 
to
 
connect
 
those
 
tools
 
–
 
even
 
if
 
Outfunnel
 
hadn’t
 
built
 
that
 
particular
 
integration.
 
These
 
pages
 
offered
 
a
 
description
 
of
 
the
 
imagined
 
integration
 
and
 
invited
 
visitors
 
to
 
join
 
a
 
waitlist
 
or
 
fill
 
out
 
a
 
form
 
if
 
interested
 
[25]
.
 
This
 
savvy
 
tactic
 
served
 
two
 
purposes:
 
it
 
attracted
 
high-intent
 
organic
 
traffic
 
(people
 
literally
 
searching
 
for
 
solutions
 
Outfunnel
 
could
 
eventually
 
provide)
 
and
 
it
 
validated
 
demand
 
for
 
which
 
integrations
 
to
 
develop
 
next
 
by
 
measuring
 
clicks/signups
 
[23]
[25]
.
 
Essentially,
 
Outfunnel
 
used
 
content
 
as
 
a
 
low-cost
 
MVP
 
to
 
guide
 
product
 
roadmap
 
(Principle:
 
Feedback
 
Loop
 
&
 
Curiosity).
 
Over
 
time,
 
as
 
real
 
integrations
 
launched,
 
those
 
pages
 
were
 
already
 
ranking
 
on
 
Google,
 
giving
 
Outfunnel
 
durable
 
traffic
 
with
 
minimal
 
ad
 
spend
 
[24]
.
 
●
 
Deep
 
Educational
 
Content
:
 
Given
 
that
 
Outfunnel’s
 
concept
 
(syncing
 
marketing
 
data
 
to
 
CRM)
 
might
 
not
 
be
 
immediately
 
obvious
 
to
 
SMB
 
marketers,
 
the
 
team
 
put
 
heavy
 
emphasis
 
on
 
educational
 
content
 
and
 
SEO
 
from
 
day
 
one
 
[26]
.
 
They
 
published
 
guides
 
like
 
“B2B
 
Lead
 
Generation
 
Strategies”
 
and
 
“Marketing
 
Attribution
 
101”,
 
which
 
helped
 
their
 
audience
 
understand
 
the
 
problems
 
Outfunnel
 
solves.
 
By
 
not
 
pushing
 
the
 
product
 
directly
 
but
 
truly
 
informing
 
readers,
 
Outfunnel
 
built
 
credibility
 
(Principle:
 
Authority).
 
This
 
content
 
also
 
drove
 
organic
 
search
 
traffic
 
for
 
broad
 
top-of-funnel
 
queries
 
(e.g.
 
someone
 
searching
 
“how
 
to
 
track
 
marketing
 
leads
 
in
 
CRM”
 
could
 
discover
 
Outfunnel’s
 
blog).
 
Liibert
 
noted
 
that
 
their
 
focus
 
was
 
“quality
 
over
 
quantity”
 
–
 
a
 
few
 
deeply
 
informative
 
pieces
 
that
 
rank
 
well
 
and
 
get
 
shared
 
can
 
do
 
more
 
for
 
awareness
 
than
 
dozens
 
of
 
superficial
 
posts
 
[26]
.
 
Over
 
time,
 
this
 
positioned
 
Outfunnel
 
as
 
a
 
knowledgeable
 
voice
 
in
 
MarTech,
 
making
 
prospects
 
comfortable
 
with
 
the
 
brand.
 
●
 
Active
 
Community
 
Participation
:
 
Outfunnel
 
smartly
 
went
 
to
 
where
 
conversations
 
were
 
already
 
happening
 
about
 
the
 
tools
 
they
 
integrate.
 
They
 
became
 
active
 
in
 
communities
 
like
 
the
 
Pipedrive
 
users
 
forum
 
and
 
other
 
niche
 
marketing
 
&
 
sales
 
groups
 
[27]
.
 
By
 
answering
 
questions
 
and
 
contributing
 
to
 
discussions
 
(without
 
overtly
 
selling),
 
they
 
put
 
the
 
Outfunnel
 
name
 
on
 
the
 
radar
 
of
 
potential
 
customers
 
in
 
a
 
genuine
 
way.
 
This
 
community-led
 
growth
 
built
 
goodwill
 
and
 
organic
 
visibility
 
(Principle:
 
Reciprocity
 
&
 
Familiarity
 
–
 
they
 
offered
 
help
 
first,
 
so
 
when
 
users
 
later
 
encountered
 
the
 
brand
 
in
 
a
 
marketing
 
context,
 
it
 
felt
 
trustworthy).
 
The
 
team
 
also
 
cites
 
examples
 
of
 
other
 
startups
 
(like
 
lemlist
 
and
 
Copy.ai)
 
that
 
thrived
 
via
 
community
 
engagement
 
[28]
,
 
reinforcing
 
their
 
belief
 
that
 
an
 
authentic
 
presence
 
in
 
user
 
communities
 
can
 
outperform
 
expensive
 
ads
 
when
 
budgets
 
are
 
lean.
 
●
 
Leveraging
 
Customer
 
Frustrations
:
 
Outfunnel’s
 
marketing
 
often
 
addressed
 
pain
 
points
 
the
 
audience
 
actively
 
experienced
 
(e.g.
 
“tired
 
of
 
importing
 
CSVs
 
between
 
Mailchimp
 
and
 
your
 
CRM?”).
 
By
 
echoing
 
these
 
frustrations
 
in
 
blog
 
posts
 
and
 
forums,
 
they
 
tapped
 
into
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
familiarity
 
(“this
 
company
 
understands
 
my
 
exact
 
problem!”).
 
This
 
emotional
 
resonance,
 
combined
 
with
 
social
 
proof
 
from
 
peer
 
discussions,
 
meant
 
that
 
when
 
users
 
felt
 
the
 
pain
 
acutely
 
(like
 
messing
 
up
 
a
 
sales
 
follow-up
 
due
 
to
 
disconnected
 
tools
 
[29]
),
 
Outfunnel
 
was
 
top-of-mind
 
as
 
the
 
organic
 
solution
 
they
 
“happened
 
to
 
hear
 
about”
 
recently.
 
Timing
 
and
 
empathy
 
were
 
key
 
–
 
they
 
let
 
frustration
 
drive
 
users
 
to
 
search
 
for
 
a
 
solution,
 
and
 
ensured
 
Outfunnel
 
was
 
discoverable
 
at
 
that
 
moment
 
[29]
.
 
Behavioral
 
principles
 
used:
 
Timing,
 
Relevance,
 
Social
 
Proof,
 
Authority,
 
and
 
Fit.
 
Outfunnel
 
demonstrates
 
how
 
meeting
 
users
 
at
 
moments
 
of
 
existing
 
demand
 
drives
 
efficient
 
awareness.
 
By
 
appearing
 
in
 
integration
 
marketplaces
 
and
 
ranking
 
for
 
high-intent
 
“tool
 
+
 
tool”
 
searches,
 
Outfunnel
 
capitalized
 
on
 
users
 
already
 
motivated
 
to
 
solve
 
a
 
problem.
 
Reviews
 
and

Webflow:
 
Creator
 
Communities,
 
Education,
 
and
 
Compounding
 
Familiarity
 
Webflow,
 
a
 
no-code
 
website
 
design
 
platform,
 
took
 
a
 
community-and-content
 
approach
 
to
 
make
 
itself
 
synonymous
 
with
 
modern
 
web
 
design,
 
all
 
while
 
riding
 
a
 
wave
 
of
 
user
 
evangelism:
 
●
 
Focus
 
on
 
a
 
“Channel”
 
Persona
:
 
From
 
the
 
start,
 
Webflow
 
zeroed
 
in
 
on
 
freelance
 
web
 
designers
 
and
 
small
 
agencies
 
as
 
its
 
primary
 
customers
 
[30]
[31]
.
 
This
 
wasn’t
 
just
 
because
 
they
 
needed
 
Webflow’s
 
capabilities
 
the
 
most,
 
but
 
also
 
because
 
each
 
designer
 
could
 
bring
 
Webflow
 
into
 
dozens
 
of
 
client
 
projects.
 
A
 
single
 
freelancer
 
investing
 
time
 
to
 
learn
 
Webflow
 
would
 
subsequently
 
deliver
 
websites
 
for
 
many
 
clients
 
using
 
Webflow,
 
essentially
 
acting
 
as
 
a
 
multiplier
 
for
 
adoption
 
[31]
.
 
By
 
deeply
 
serving
 
this
 
persona
 
(with
 
features
 
like
 
client
 
billing,
 
white-labeling,
 
and
 
an
 
CMS
 
for
 
designers),
 
Webflow
 
turned
 
agencies
 
into
 
a
 
growth
 
engine.
 
Every
 
client
 
who
 
got
 
a
 
Webflow-built
 
site
 
was
 
a
 
new
 
potential
 
Webflow
 
user.
 
(Principle:
 
Network
 
Effects
 
via
 
Partners
 
–
 
similar
 
to
 
how
 
Shopify
 
grew
 
via
 
developers
 
and
 
agencies,
 
Webflow
 
leveraged
 
designers
 
as
 
distribution
 
partners,
 
backed
 
by
 
authority
 
trust
 
since
 
clients
 
trust
 
their
 
designers’
 
tool
 
choices.)
 
●
 
Webflow
 
University
 
&
 
Tutorials
:
 
A
 
cornerstone
 
of
 
Webflow’s
 
awareness
 
strategy
 
was
 
creating
 
an
 
educational
 
empire
 
around
 
no-code
 
web
 
design.
 
They
 
launched
 
Webflow
 
University,
 
a
 
free
 
learning
 
center
 
with
 
hundreds
 
of
 
video
 
lessons
 
on
 
using
 
Webflow
 
and
 
general
 
design
 
principles.
 
They
 
also
 
produced
 
slick
 
YouTube
 
tutorials,
 
how-to
 
articles,
 
and
 
even
 
a
 
frequent
 
webinar
 
series.
 
This
 
content
 
marketing
 
was
 
less
 
about
 
Webflow’s
 
product
 
and
 
more
 
about
 
teaching
 
skills
 
(e.g.
 
CSS
 
basics,
 
responsive
 
design
 
techniques)
 
–
 
which
 
subtly
 
led
 
people
 
to
 
prefer
 
Webflow
 
as
 
the
 
tool
 
of
 
choice.
 
By
 
2020,
 
Webflow’s
 
YouTube
 
channel
 
had
 
over
 
60,000
 
subscribers
 
and
 
millions
 
of
 
views
 
[32]
,
 
making
 
it
 
a
 
top-of-funnel
 
magnet.
 
Notably,
 
YouTube
 
became
 
Webflow’s
 
largest
 
social
 
traffic
 
source
 
for
 
new
 
users
 
[33]
.
 
Whenever
 
someone
 
searched
 
“how
 
do
 
I
 
build
 
a
 
responsive
 
website
 
without
 
code?”,
 
Webflow’s
 
video
 
would
 
likely
 
appear,
 
funneling
 
that
 
viewer
 
into
 
the
 
Webflow
 
ecosystem.
 
(Principle:
 
Authority
 
&
 
Reciprocity
 
–
 
Webflow
 
gave
 
away
 
knowledge;
 
in
 
return
 
they
 
earned
 
trust
 
and
 
a
 
following.
 
Educated
 
prospects
 
naturally
 
chose
 
the
 
teacher’s
 
platform.)
 
●
 
SEO
 
via
 
Templates
 
and
 
UGC
:
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
a
 
traditional
 
blog,
 
Webflow
 
harnessed
 
user-generated
 
content
 
to
 
drive
 
organic
 
traffic.
 
They
 
created
 
a
 
showcase
 
where
 
users
 
could
 
share
 
their
 
public
 
Webflow
 
projects
 
and
 
a
 
template
 
marketplace
 
for
 
website
 
themes.
 
These
 
pages
 
attracted
 
both
 
inspiration-seekers
 
and
 
search
 
engines.
 
For
 
instance,
 
Webflow’s
 
template
 
library
 
ranks
 
for
 
terms
 
like
 
“free
 
portfolio
 
website
 
template”,
 
drawing
 
in
 
designers
 
who
 
may
 
not
 
have
 
heard
 
of
 
Webflow
 
yet.
 
According
 
to
 
one
 
growth
 
teardown,
 
Webflow’s
 
site
 
was
 
generating
 
traffic
 
for
 
non-branded
 
keywords
 
like
 
“free
 
templates”
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
its
 
strong
 
branded
 
searches
 
[34]
[35]
.
 
Once
 
visitors
 
landed
 
on
 
these
 
pages,
 
they
 
not
 
only
 
saw
 
Webflow’s
 
capabilities
 
but
 
also
 
social
 
proof
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
community
 
“likes,”
 
cloneable
 
projects,
 
and
 
comments.
 
Seeing
 
a
 
vibrant
 
community
 
of
 
creators
 
signaled
 
that
 
Webflow
 
was
 
the
 
place
 
to
 
be
 
for
 
modern
 
web
 
design
 
(Principle:
 
Social
 
Proof/FOMO
 
–
 
“everyone’s
 
using
 
this
 
cool
 
tool!”).
 
This
 
content
 
also
 
had
 
a
 
viral
 
loop:
 
designers
 
shared
 
their
 
Webflow
 
creations
 
on
 
social
 
media,
 
indirectly
 
promoting
 
Webflow
 
itself.
 
●
 
Social
 
Media
 
Buzz
 
&
 
Influencers
:
 
Webflow
 
benefited
 
greatly
 
from
 
designers
 
and
 
tech
 
influencers
 
organically
 
raving
 
about
 
it
 
on
 
Twitter
 
and
 
beyond.
 
By
 
mid-2010s,
 
as
 
no-code
 
emerged
 
as
 
a
 
trend,
 
Webflow
 
became
 
a
 
darling
 
of
 
the
 
design
 
Twitter
 
community.
 
The
 
Webflow
 
team
 
actively
 
stoked
 
this
 
by
 
engaging
 
with
 
influencers
 
(e.g.
 
sponsoring
 
design
 
YouTubers,
 
collaborating
 
with
 
well-known
 
digital
 
makers).
 
They
 
even
 
leveraged
 
user
 
tweets
 
as
 
testimonials
 
–
 
in
 
2016
 
Webflow’s
 
homepage
 
featured
 
real
 
tweets
 
praising
 
the
 
product
 
as
 
a
 
form
 
of
 
social
 
proof

social

was

This
 
created
 
a

loop:
 
the
 
more
 
people
 
shared

discovered

–
 
and

–

from

●
 
Community
 
and
 
Events
:
 
Webflow
 
understood
 
that
 
a
 
passionate
 
community
 
can
 
amplify
 
awareness.
 
They
 
fostered
 
a
 
forum
 
where
 
users
 
helped
 
each
 
other
 
(driving
 
engagement
 
and
 
retention,
 
which
 
spills
 
into
 
advocacy).
 
They
 
also
 
began
 
hosting
 
global
 
community
 
events,
 
culminating
 
in
 
the
 
No-Code
 
Conf,
 
a
 
conference
 
celebrating
 
no-code
 
development.
 
These
 
efforts
 
generated
 
PR
 
and
 
excitement
 
well
 
beyond
 
their
 
existing
 
user
 
base.
 
For
 
example,
 
when
 
Vlad
 
Magdalin
 
(Webflow’s
 
CEO)
 
shared
 
his
 
vision
 
for
 
a
 
no-code
 
movement,
 
it
 
was
 
covered
 
in
 
tech
 
media
 
and
 
resonated
 
with
 
entrepreneurs
 
who
 
then
 
checked
 
out
 
Webflow
 
[37]
[38]
.
 
By
 
championing
 
a
 
larger
 
mission
 
(“democratize
 
web
 
creation”),
 
Webflow
 
attracted
 
top-of-funnel
 
interest
 
from
 
people
 
who
 
wanted
 
to
 
be
 
part
 
of
 
that
 
story
 
–
 
essentially
 
turning
 
brand
 
awareness
 
into
 
a
 
cause
 
(Principle:
 
Identity
 
&
 
Belonging).
 
Behavioral
 
principles
 
used:
 
Commitment,
 
Familiarity,
 
Authority,
 
Social
 
Proof,
 
and
 
Retention.
 
Webflow
 
shows
 
how
 
deep
 
investment
 
in
 
education
 
and
 
community
 
turns
 
users
 
into
 
long-term
 
advocates.
 
By
 
helping
 
creators
 
build
 
real
 
assets
 
for
 
free,
 
Webflow
 
increased
 
emotional
 
and
 
time-based
 
commitment.
 
Ongoing
 
exposure
 
through
 
tutorials,
 
showcases,
 
and
 
community
 
validation
 
made
 
Webflow
 
feel
 
inevitable
 
rather
 
than
 
optional
 
when
 
users
 
were
 
ready
 
to
 
launch.
 
 
10
 
Experiments
 
for
 
Reform
 
to
 
Boost
 
Top-of-Funnel
 
Awareness
 
Reform
 
is
 
a
 
modern,
 
conversion-focused
 
form
 
builder
 
targeting
 
growth
 
marketers
 
and
 
lean
 
B2B
 
teams.
 
Drawing
 
inspiration
 
from
 
the
 
successes
 
above,
 
here
 
are
 
ten
 
organic
 
top-of-funnel
 
experiments
 
Reform
 
can
 
run
 
to
 
boost
 
brand
 
awareness,
 
prioritized
 
by
 
a
 
composite
 
I.C.E.E.E.
 
score
 
(Impact,
 
Confidence,
 
and
 
ease
 
across
 
Engineering,
 
Marketing,
 
and
 
Other
 
Effort):
 
1—Add
 
Social
 
Proof
 
to
 
Signup
 
Flow
 
–
 
Increase
 
trust
 
at
 
first
 
contact
 
Hypothesis:
 
If
 
new
 
users
 
see
 
credible
 
social
 
proof
 
at
 
signup,
 
such
 
as
 
recognizable
 
logos,
 
usage
 
numbers,
 
or
 
short
 
outcome-driven
 
testimonials,
 
they
 
will
 
feel
 
safer
 
committing
 
time
 
to
 
Reform,
 
resulting
 
in
 
higher
 
activation
 
and
 
downstream
 
conversion.
 
This
 
reduces
 
uncertainty
 
by
 
signaling
 
that
 
others
 
like
 
them
 
already
 
trust
 
the
 
product
 
(Principle
 
of
 
Social
 
Proof).
 
Channel/Surface:
 
Website
 
signup
 
page
 
and
 
first
 
in-app
 
welcome
 
screen.
 
What
 
to
 
Test:
 
Test
 
a
 
signup
 
variant
 
that
 
includes
 
customer
 
logos,
 
short
 
testimonials,
 
or
 
a
 
usage
 
stat
 
like
 
“Trusted
 
by
 
5,000+
 
growth
 
teams,”
 
versus
 
a
 
control
 
with
 
no
 
proof.
 
Optionally
 
test
 
a
 
welcome
 
modal
 
highlighting
 
a
 
concise
 
success
 
story.
 
Success
 
Metric:
 
Signup-to-activation
 
rate
 
(form
 
created
 
within
 
24–48
 
hours)
 
and
 
trial-to-paid
 
conversion
 
rate.
 
Behavioral
 
Principle:
 
Social
 
Proof
 
–
 
People
 
infer
 
safety
 
and
 
correctness
 
from
 
the
 
behavior
 
of
 
others.
 
Showing
 
adoption
 
early
 
reduces
 
hesitation
 
and
 
increases
 
commitment.

to
 
first
 
value
 
Hypothesis:
 
If
 
users
 
are
 
shown
 
relevant
 
templates
 
immediately
 
after
 
signup,
 
they
 
will
 
reach
 
their
 
“aha”
 
moment
 
faster,
 
increasing
 
perceived
 
value
 
and
 
long-term
 
engagement.
 
Blank
 
states
 
create
 
friction
 
and
 
uncertainty,
 
while

What
 
to
 
Test:
 
Compare
 
a
 
blank-form
 
default
 
versus
 
a
 
curated
 
gallery
 
of
 
5–7
 
use-case-driven
 
templates
 
such
 
as
 
Lead
 
Gen,
 
Event

Form.
 
Success
 
Metric:

who
 
publish
 
a

Behavioral
 
Principle:

3—Integration
 
Landing
 
Pages
 
for
 
SEO
 
–
 
Capture
 
existing
 
demand
 
Hypothesis:
 
If
 
Reform
 
publishes
 
dedicated
 
pages
 
for
 
high-intent
 
integrations
 
like
 
“Reform
 
+
 
HubSpot”
 
or
 
“Reform
 
+
 
Salesforce,”
 
it
 
will
 
attract
 
qualified
 
organic
 
traffic
 
from
 
users
 
already
 
seeking
 
solutions,
 
increasing
 
awareness
 
among
 
high-fit
 
buyers
 
(Principle
 
of
 
Timing).
 
Channel/Surface:
 
SEO
 
landing
 
pages
 
and

directory.
 
What
 
to
 
Test:
 
Launch
 
10–15
 
integration-specific
 
pages
 
optimized
 
for
 
“tool
 
+
 
tool”
 
search
 
intent
 
and
 
compare
 
organic
 
traffic,
 
signup
 
rate,
 
and
 
lead
 
quality
 
against
 
generic
 
feature
 
pages.
 
Success
 
Metric:
 
Organic
 
sessions,
 
signup
 
conversion
 
rate
 
from
 
integration
 
pages,
 
and
 
downstream
 
activation.
 
Behavioral
 
Principle:
 
Timing
 
–
 
Marketing
 
performs
 
best
 
when
 
it
 
meets
 
existing
 
demand
 
rather
 
than
 
creating
 
new
 
intent.
 
4—“Powered
 
by
 
Reform”
 
Form
 
Branding
 
–
 
Turn
 
usage
 
into
 
distribution
 
Hypothesis:
 
If
 
free-plan
 
forms
 
include
 
subtle
 
“Powered
 
by
 
Reform”
 
branding,
 
every
 
shared
 
form
 
becomes
 
a
 
distribution
 
surface,
 
compounding
 
awareness
 
through
 
real-world
 
usage
 
rather
 
than
 
ads
 
(Principle
 
of
 
Distribution).
 
Channel/Surface:
 
Public
 
form
 
footer
 
and
 
submission
 
confirmation
 
screens.
 
What
 
to
 
Test:
 
A/B
 
test
 
branded
 
versus
 
unbranded
 
free-plan
 
forms
 
and
 
measure
 
referral
 
traffic
 
and
 
assisted
 
signups.
 
Success
 
Metric:

5—Educational
 
SEO
 
Content
 
Focused
 
on
 
Lead
 
Quality
 
–
 
Build
 
authority
 
Hypothesis:
 
If
 
Reform
 
publishes
 
authoritative
 
content
 
on
 
lead
 
quality,
 
enrichment,
 
and
 
conversion-focused
 
forms,
 
it
 
will
 
earn
 
trust
 
and
 
organic
 
traffic
 
from
 
growth
 
marketers
 
who
 
later
 
convert
 
when
 
the
 
need
 
arises
 
(Principles
 
of
 
Authority
 
and
 
Familiarity).
 
Channel/Surface:
 
Blog
 
and
 
resource
 
hub.
 
What
 
to
 
Test:
 
Publish
 
5–10
 
deep,
 
non-promotional
 
articles
 
such
 
as
 
“Why
 
Most
 
Lead
 
Forms
 
Fail”
 
or
 
“How
 
to
 
Reduce
 
Form
 
Drop-Off
 
Without
 
Shortening
 
Forms,”
 
then
 
compare
 
organic
 
growth
 
versus
 
generic
 
product
 
updates.
 
Success
 
Metric:
 
Organic
 
traffic
 
growth,
 
returning
 
visitors,
 
and
 
assisted
 
conversions.
 
Behavioral
 
Principle:
 
Authority
 
and
 
Familiarity
 
–
 
Repeated
 
exposure
 
to
 
credible
 
insights
 
increases
 
trust
 
and
 
recall
 
over
 
time.
 
6—Community
 
Participation
 
Without
 
Selling
 
–
 
Earn
 
attention
 
before
 
asking
 
Hypothesis:
 
If
 
Reform
 
team
 
members
 
actively
 
help
 
in
 
growth
 
and
 
marketing
 
communities
 
without
 
pitching,
 
the
 
brand
 
will
 
gain
 
credibility
 
and
 
organic
 
word-of-mouth
 
mentions
 
when
 
users
 
seek
 
recommendations
 
(Principles
 
of
 
Reciprocity
 
and
 
Trust).
 
Channel/Surface:
 
Slack
 
groups,
 
Reddit,
 
LinkedIn
 
comments,
 
and
 
niche
 
communities.
 
What
 
to
 
Test:
 
Have
 
team
 
members
 
answer
 
questions
 
around
 
lead
 
capture
 
and
 
form
 
optimization
 
for
 
30
 
days,
 
with
 
no
 
links
 
unless
 
explicitly
 
asked.
 
Track
 
brand
 
mentions
 
and
 
inbound
 
traffic
 
lift.
 
Success
 
Metric:
 
Branded
 
search
 
growth,
 
direct
 
traffic,
 
and
 
unsolicited
 
mentions.
 
Behavioral
 
Principle:
 
Reciprocity
 
and
 
Trust
 
–
 
Helping
 
first
 
lowers
 
resistance
 
and
 
increases
 
goodwill.
 
7—Customer
 
Story
 
Snippets
 
Across
 
Touchpoints
 
–
 
Make
 
outcomes
 
tangible
 
Hypothesis:
 
If
 
Reform
 
highlights
 
short,
 
outcome-focused
 
customer
 
stories
 
throughout
 
the
 
site
 
and
 
product,
 
prospects
 
will
 
more
 
easily
 
imagine
 
success,
 
increasing
 
trial
 
engagement
 
(Principle
 
of
 
Proof
 
Over
 
Promise).
 
Channel/Surface:
 
Homepage,
 
signup
 
page,
 
in-app
 
welcome,
 
and
 
templates
 
gallery.
 
What
 
to
 
Test:
 
Replace
 
feature-heavy
 
copy
 
with
 
brief
 
outcome
 
statements
 
like
 
“40%
 
higher
 
form
 
completion
 
for
 
B2B
 
SaaS
 
teams”
 
and
 
compare
 
engagement.
 
Success
 
Metric:
 
Signup
 
conversion
 
rate
 
and
 
first-session
 
engagement.
 
Behavioral
 
Principle:
 
Proof
 
Over
 
Promise
 
–
 
Evidence
 
reduces
 
skepticism
 
more
 
effectively
 
than
 
claims.

8—Marketplace
 
Listings
 
with
 
Review
 
Seeding
 
–
 
Borrow
 
trust
 
Hypothesis:
 
If
 
Reform
 
is
 
visibly
 
present
 
and
 
well-reviewed
 
on
 
relevant
 
marketplaces,
 
prospects
 
will
 
transfer
 
trust
 
from
 
the
 
platform
 
to
 
the
 
product,
 
accelerating
 
awareness
 
and
 
adoption
 
(Principle
 
of
 
Authority).
 
Channel/Surface:
 
Integration
 
marketplaces
 
and
 
SaaS
 
review
 
platforms.
 
What
 
to
 
Test:
 
Actively
 
solicit
 
reviews
 
from
 
engaged
 
users
 
and
 
compare
 
referral
 
traffic
 
and
 
conversion
 
rates
 
before
 
and
 
after
 
review
 
volume
 
increases.
 
Success
 
Metric:
 
Marketplace-driven
 
signups
 
and
 
conversion
 
rate.
 
Behavioral
 
Principle:
 
Authority
 
–
 
Trust
 
is
 
borrowed
 
from
 
established
 
institutions
 
until
 
your
 
own
 
brand
 
is
 
familiar.
 
9—Free
 
Utility
 
or
 
Diagnostic
 
Tool
 
–
 
Create
 
shareable
 
value
 
Hypothesis:
 
If
 
Reform
 
offers
 
a
 
lightweight,
 
free
 
diagnostic
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
Form
 
Conversion
 
Grader,
 
it
 
will
 
attract
 
top-of-funnel
 
traffic
 
and
 
shares
 
while
 
positioning
 
Reform
 
as
 
an
 
expert
 
(Principle
 
of
 
Leverage).
 
Channel/Surface:
 
Standalone
 
landing
 
page
 
and
 
social
 
sharing.
 
What
 
to
 
Test:
 
Launch
 
one
 
free
 
tool
 
and
 
measure
 
organic
 
traffic
 
and
 
signup
 
assists
 
compared
 
to
 
standard
 
blog
 
posts.
 
Success
 
Metric:
 
Unique
 
visitors,
 
shares,
 
backlinks,
 
and
 
assisted
 
conversions.
 
Behavioral
 
Principle:
 
Leverage
 
–
 
Systems
 
that
 
create
 
reusable
 
value
 
outperform
 
linear
 
tactics.
 
10—Partner
 
Content
 
with
 
GTM
 
&
 
GTME
 
Tools
 
–
 
Expand
 
reach
 
through
 
alignment
 
Hypothesis:
 
If
 
Reform
 
co-creates
 
content
 
with
 
complementary
 
GTM,
 
GTM
 
Engineering
 
&
 
AI
 
tools
 
(Clay,
 
Lovable
 
etc),
 
it
 
will
 
access
 
adjacent
 
audiences
 
with
 
higher
 
relevance
 
and
 
trust
 
(Principle
 
of
 
Alignment).
 
Channel/Surface:
 
Webinars,
 
co-authored
 
blog
 
posts,
 
and
 
shared
 
email
 
lists.
 
What
 
to
 
Test:
 
Run
 
one
 
co-marketed
 
webinar
 
or
 
guide
 
and
 
compare
 
signup
 
quality
 
to
 
solo
 
content.
 
Success
 
Metric:
 
New
 
signups
 
from
 
partner
 
channels
 
and
 
activation
 
rate.
 
Behavioral
 
Principle:
 
Alignment
 
–
 
Growth
 
accelerates
 
when
 
product,
 
audience,
 
and
 
channel
 
reinforce
 
each
 
other.

11—Creator,
 
Freelancer
 
&
 
Agency
 
Incentives
 
via
 
GTM
 
Integrations
 
–
 
Turn
 
builders
 
into
 
distributors
 
Hypothesis:
 
If
 
Reform
 
explicitly
 
targets
 
creators,
 
freelancers,
 
and
 
agencies
 
who
 
already
 
build
 
GTM
 
workflows,
 
and
 
rewards
 
them
 
with
 
affiliate
 
payouts
 
and
 
usage
 
credits,
 
they
 
will
 
actively
 
promote
 
Reform
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
their
 
stack.
 
This
 
turns
 
Reform
 
into
 
a
 
default
 
infrastructure
 
choice
 
rather
 
than
 
just
 
another
 
tool,
 
compounding
 
awareness
 
through
 
repeated
 
client
 
and
 
audience
 
exposure.
 
Channel/Surface:
 
Integrations
 
pages,
 
partner
 
hub,
 
creator
 
landing
 
page,
 
and
 
in-product
 
referral
 
surface.
 
What
 
to
 
Test:
 
Launch
 
a
 
lightweight
 
partner
 
program
 
modeled
 
after
 
Clay
 
and
 
Webflow
 
(possibly
 
via
 
Partnerstack):
 
●
 
Offer
 
affiliates
 
recurring
 
commission
 
or
 
Reform
 
credits
 
per
 
referred
 
workspace.
 
●
 
Position
 
Reform
 
as
 
“the
 
form
 
layer
 
for
 
GTM
 
workflows”
 
across
 
HubSpot,
 
Salesforce,
 
Slack,
 
Zapier,
 
and
 
Reverse
 
ETL
 
tools.
 
●
 
Create
 
a
 
dedicated
 
landing
 
page
 
for
 
creators
 
and
 
agencies
 
showing
 
how
 
they
 
can
 
build,
 
reuse,
 
and
 
monetize
 
workflows
 
on
 
Reform.
 
●
 
Test
 
against
 
a
 
control
 
with
 
no
 
explicit
 
creator
 
or
 
agency
 
positioning.
 
Success
 
Metric:
 
Referred
 
signups
 
per
 
partner,
 
number
 
of
 
active
 
partner-created
 
forms,
 
and
 
branded
 
search
 
lift
 
driven
 
by
 
creator
 
content.
 
Behavioral
 
Principle:
 
Distribution
 
and
 
Leverage
 
–
 
Incentivized
 
builders
 
act
 
as
 
repeat
 
distributors
 
across
 
multiple
 
clients
 
and
 
audiences.
 
Familiarity
 
compounds
 
as
 
Reform
 
becomes
 
embedded
 
in
 
real
 
GTM
 
workflows
 
used
 
repeatedly.

Engineering

Positioning
 
–
 
Reframe
 
Reform
 
as
 
programmable

Hypothesis:
 
If
 
Reform
 
is
 
positioned
 
and
 
demonstrated
 
as
 
a
 
tool
 
GTM
 
engineers
 
and
 
vibe
 
coders
 
actively
 
use
 
to
 
build

workflows,
 
it
 
will
 
gain
 
credibility
 
and
 
awareness
 
within
 
a
 
fast-growing
 
technical-adjacent
 
audience
 
that
 
influences
 
tool
 
adoption.
 
Showing
 
real
 
builds
 
will
 
attract
 
attention
 
and
 
signal
 
that
 
Reform
 
is
 
not
 
just
 
a
 
form
 
builder,
 
but
 
a
 
composable
 
GTM
 
component.
 
Channel/Surface:
 
Developer-focused
 
content,
 
social
 
demos
 
(LinkedIn,

What
 
to
 
Test:
 
Publish
 
and
 
promote
 
concrete
 
examples
 
such
 
as:
 
●
 
“How
 
a
 
GTM
 
engineer
 
uses
 
Reform
 
+
 
HubSpot
 
+
 
Slack
 
to
 
qualify

automatically.”
 
●
 
“How
 
vibe
 
coders
 
embed
 
Reform
 
into
 
AI-powered

or
 
lead
 
routing
 
flows.”
 
●
 
Short
 
build-in-public

showing
 
Reform
 
wired
 
into
 
real

●
 
Compare
 
engagement

this
 
positioning
 
versus

Prioritization
 
Rationale
:
 
 
●
 
We
 
prioritize
 
experiments
 
that
 
embed
 
Reform
 
into
 
real
 
workflows
 
and
 
surfaces
 
where
 
discovery
 
happens
 
naturally,
 
before
 
investing
 
in
 
heavier
 
narrative
 
or
 
ecosystem
 
plays.
 
The
 
goal
 
at
 
this
 
stage
 
is
 
not
 
persuasion,
 
but
 
repeated
 
exposure,
 
trust
 
formation,
 
and
 
compounding
 
distribution.
 
●
 
The
 
highest-priority
 
experiment
 
is
 
“Powered
 
by
 
Reform”
 
form
 
branding
 
(#4).
 
It
 
scores
 
highest
 
across
 
Impact
 
and
 
Confidence
 
with
 
minimal
 
effort
 
because
 
it
 
turns
 
every
 
shared
 
form
 
into
 
a
 
passive
 
acquisition
 
channel.
 
This
 
directly
 
aligns
 
with
 
Reform’s
 
PLG
 
motion
 
and
 
mirrors
 
proven
 
distribution
 
loops
 
used
 
by
 
Typeform,
 
Webflow,
 
and
 
Calendly.
 
Once
 
live,
 
it
 
compounds
 
without
 
additional
 
marketing
 
input.

The

and
 
social

at

These
 
experiments
 
capture
 
existing
 
demand,
 
reduce
 
uncertainty
 
at
 
discovery,
 
and
 
accelerate
 
first
 
value.
 
They
 
work
 
together:
 
search
 
brings
 
the
 
right
 
audience,
 
templates
 
help
 
them
 
act
 
quickly,
 
and
 
social

they

●
 
Educational
 
SEO
 
content
 
(#5)
 
and
 
customer
 
story
 
snippets
 
(#7)
 
sit
 
just
 
behind
 
this
 
tier.
 
These
 
are
 
authority
 
builders
 
rather
 
than
 
direct
 
acquisition
 
drivers.
 
They
 
increase
 
familiarity
 
and
 
trust
 
over
 
time
 
and
 
improve
 
the
 
performance
 
of
 
all
 
other
 
channels
 
by
 
shaping
 
how
 
Reform
 
is
 
perceived
 
when
 
prospects
 
encounter
 
it
 
again.
 
●
 
Mid-priority
 
strategic
 
bets
 
include
 
creator,
 
freelancer,
 
and
 
agency
 
incentives
 
(#11)
 
and
 
GTM
 
engineering
 
and
 
vibe-coding
 
positioning
 
(#12).
 
These
 
have
 
strong
 
long-term
 
upside
 
but
 
require
 
clearer
 
integration
 
depth
 
and
 
positioning
 
clarity
 
to
 
succeed.
 
Once
 
Reform
 
is
 
stable
 
as
 
a
 
GTM
 
workflow
 
layer,
 
these
 
experiments
 
can
 
turn
 
builders
 
into
 
repeat
 
distributors
 
and
 
reposition
 
Reform
 
from
 
“form
 
builder”
 
to
 
“revenue
 
infrastructure.”
 
●
 
Lower-priority
 
experiments
 
such
 
as
 
community
 
participation
 
(#6),
 
marketplace
 
review
 
seeding
 
(#8),
 
partner
 
content
 
(#10),
 
and
 
free
 
utilities
 
(#9)
 
act
 
as
 
multipliers
 
rather
 
than
 
foundations.
 
They
 
are
 
most
 
effective
 
once
 
Reform
 
already
 
has
 
visible
 
proof,
 
integrations,
 
and
 
a
 
clear
 
narrative
 
to
 
amplify.
 
Running
 
them
 
too
 
early
 
risks

Overall,
 
the
 
sequencing
 
favors
 
distribution
 
before
 
storytelling
.
 
Reform
 
should
 
first
 
ensure
 
it
 
shows
 
up
 
consistently
 
in
 
workflows,
 
search
 
results,
 
and
 
shared
 
artifacts.
 
Once
 
awareness
 
compounds
 
through
 
these
 
embedded
 
channels,
 
authority,
 
creators,
 
and
 
partnerships
 
become
 
cheaper
 
and
 
more
 
effective.
 
This
 
approach
 
follows
 
the
 
Principle
 
of
 
Compounding:
 
small,
 
durable
 
visibility
 
gains
 
stack
 
over
 
time,
 
making

GTM
 
effort
 
more
 
efficient
 
and
 
defensible.
