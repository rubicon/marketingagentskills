Laws

Principles
 
 
There
 
is
 
no
 
single,
 
agreed-upon
 
number
 
of
 
marketing
 
laws
 
or
 
principles.
 
Marketing
 
principles
 
are
 
not
 
like
 
physical
 
laws.
 
They
 
are
 
patterns
 
observed
 
over
 
time,
 
named
 
and
 
grouped
 
by
 
different
 
thinkers,
 
often
 
overlapping
 
or
 
reworded
 
across
 
books,
 
frameworks,
 
and
 
disciplines.
 
Here
 
is
 
the
 
clearest
 
way
 
to
 
think
 
about
 
it:
 
There
 
are
 
hundreds
 
of
 
named
 
marketing
 
laws
 
and
 
principles
,
 
but
 
only
 
a
 
few
 
dozen
 
core
 
ideas
 
that
 
keep
 
reappearing
 
under
 
different
 
names.
 
Why
 
the
 
number
 
varies
 
Marketing
 
principles
 
come
 
from
 
different
 
sources:
 
●
 
Psychology
 
●
 
Economics
 
●
 
Behavioral
 
science
 
●
 
Advertising
 
●
 
Branding
 
●
 
Sales
 
●
 
Strategy
 
Each
 
author
 
curates
 
their
 
own
 
set,
 
often
 
renaming
 
similar
 
ideas
 
to
 
fit
 
their
 
thesis.
 
Well-known
 
collections
 
Some
 
popular
 
examples:
 
●
 
22
 
Immutable
 
Laws
 
of
 
Marketing
 
by
 
Ries
 
and
 
Trout
 
●
 
7
 
Principles
 
of
 
Influence
 
by
 
Cialdini
 
●
 
Mental
 
Models
 
popularized
 
by
 
Farnam
 
Street
 
and
 
Charlie
 
Munger

●
 
Brand
 
Laws
,
 
Growth
 
Laws
,
 
Pricing
 
Laws
,
 
Conversion
 
Laws
,
 
etc.
 
If
 
you
 
aggregate
 
these,
 
you
 
quickly
 
exceed
 
150–300
 
named
 
“laws”
,
 
many
 
of
 
which
 
describe
 
the
 
same
 
underlying
 
behavior.
 
The
 
reality
 
beneath
 
the
 
lists
 
Most
 
marketing
 
laws
 
collapse
 
into
 
a
 
smaller
 
set
 
of
 
fundamentals,

Practical
 
takeaway
 
You
 
do
 
not

to
 
memorize
 
hundreds
 
of
 
laws.
 
Strong
 
marketers
 
internalize:
 
●
 
10–20
 
core
 
principles
 
●
 
Learn
 
how
 
they
 
show
 
up
 
across
 
channels,
 
products,
 
and
 
markets
 
●
 
Apply
 
them
 
situationally,
 
not
 
mechanically
 
Marketing
 
rewards
 
understanding
 
patterns,
 
not
 
collecting
 
frameworks.

Marketing
 
Mental
 
Models
 
Here’s
 
a
 
single,
 
clean
 
mental
 
model
 
that
 
unifies
 
most
 
marketing
 
laws,
 
principles,
 
and
 
frameworks
 
into
 
something
 
you
 
can
 
actually
 
use
 
for
 
strategy,
 
GTM,
 
and
 
growth.
 
Think
 
of
 
marketing
 
as
 
five
 
layers
,
 
moving
 
from
 
the
 
human
 
brain
 
outward
 
to
 
the
 
market.
 
1.
 
Human
 
Reality
 
(Psychology
 
Layer)
 
Everything
 
starts
 
here.
 
This
 
layer
 
explains
 
why
 
marketing
 
works
 
or
 
fails.
 
Core
 
truths
 
●
 
Attention
 
is
 
scarce.
 
●
 
Humans
 
rely
 
on
 
shortcuts,
 
not
 
analysis.
 
●
 
Emotion
 
drives
 
action,
 
logic
 
justifies
 
it
 
later.
 
●
 
Loss
 
feels
 
stronger
 
than
 
gain.
 
●
 
Familiarity
 
creates
 
comfort.
 
This
 
layer
 
absorbs
 
●
 
Cialdini’s
 
Influence
 
principles
 
●
 
Behavioral
 
biases
 
(loss
 
aversion,
 
anchoring,
 
social
 
proof)
 
●
 
Scarcity,
 
urgency,
 
authority,
 
reciprocity
 
●
 
The
 
Mere
 
Exposure
 
Effect
 
Key
 
question
 
What
 
belief,
 
emotion,
 
or
 
perceived
 
risk
 
is
 
controlling
 
the
 
buyer’s
 
decision
 
right
 
now,
 
and
 
are
 
we
 
reducing
 
it
 
or
 
triggering
 
it?
 
If
 
you
 
ignore
 
this
 
No
 
amount
 
of
 
traffic,
 
spend,
 
or
 
tactics
 
will
 
save
 
you.
 
2.
 
Perception
 
&
 
Meaning
 
(Positioning
 
Layer)
 
Marketing
 
does
 
not
 
happen
 
in
 
your
 
product.
 
It
 
happens
 
in
 
the
 
buyer’s
 
mind.
 
Core
 
truths
 
●
 
Perception
 
beats
 
reality.
 
●
 
The
 
mind
 
compares
 
before
 
it
 
decides.
 
●
 
Categories
 
matter
 
more
 
than
 
features.
 
●
 
First
 
impressions
 
anchor
 
everything
 
else.

The
 
Unifying
 
Principle
 
All
 
marketing
 
laws
 
are
 
variations
 
of
 
this
 
sequence:
 
Human
 
psychology
 
→
 
Perception
 
→
 
Meaning
 
→
 
Friction
 
→
 
Distribution
 
When
 
something
 
fails,
 
it
 
always
 
breaks
 
at
 
one
 
layer,
 
never
 
all
 
of
 
them.
 
How
 
to
 
use
 
this
 
model
 
in
 
practice
 
When
 
diagnosing
 
a
 
problem,
 
do
 
not
 
jump
 
to
 
tactics.
 
Ask,
 
in
 
order:
 
1.
 
Is
 
this
 
fighting
 
human
 
psychology?
 
2.
 
Is
 
the
 
positioning
 
unclear
 
or
 
crowded?
 
3.
 
Is
 
the
 
value
 
poorly
 
translated?
 
4.
 
Is
 
friction
 
killing
 
momentum?
 
5.
 
Is
 
distribution
 
mismatched
 
or
 
saturated?
 
This
 
is
 
how
 
senior
 
marketers
 
think.
 
Not
 
“Which
 
framework
 
should
 
I
 
use?”
 
But
 
“Which
 
layer
 
is
 
broken?”

Foundational
 
Principles

1.
 
Principle
 
of
 
Attention
 
One-Sentence
 
Principle
 
You
 
cannot
 
persuade
 
someone
 
who
 
is
 
not
 
paying
 
attention.
 
Why
 
It
 
Exists
 
(Human
 
Reason)
 
Human
 
attention
 
is
 
limited
 
and
 
constantly
 
filtered
 
to
 
avoid
 
overload.
 
What
 
It
 
Looks
 
Like
 
in
 
Practice
 
(Real
 
Examples)
 
●
 
Apple
 
launches
 
focus
 
on
 
one
 
headline
 
feature
 
per
 
product.
 
●
 
TikTok
 
hooks
 
content
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
two
 
seconds
 
or
 
it
 
dies.
 
●
 
B2B
 
landing
 
pages
 
that
 
open
 
with
 
outcomes
 
outperform
 
feature
 
dumps.
 
What
 
Breaks
 
When
 
You
 
Ignore
 
It
 
Great
 
products
 
fail
 
silently
 
because
 
nobody
 
notices
 
them.

It
 
Shows

How
 
to
 
Use
 
It
 
Strategically
 
Win
 
attention
 
first
 
with
 
relevance
 
before
 
asking
 
for
 
understanding.
 
 
2.
 
Principle
 
of
 
Perception
 
One-Sentence
 
Principle
 
Marketing
 
is
 
not
 
about
 
what
 
you
 
build,
 
but
 
what
 
people
 
believe
 
you
 
built.
 
Why
 
It
 
Exists
 
(Human
 
Reason)
 
Humans
 
act
 
on
 
perception,
 
not
 
objective
 
truth.
 
What
 
It
 
Looks
 
Like
 
in
 
Practice
 
(Real
 
Examples)
 
●
 
Tesla
 
is
 
perceived
 
as
 
a
 
tech
 
company,
 
not
 
a
 
car
 
company.
 
●
 
Zoom
 
became
 
“the
 
video
 
call
 
app”
 
during
 
the
 
pandemic.
