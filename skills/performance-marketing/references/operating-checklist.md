# Paid Marketing Operating Checklist

*Use this every time you plan, launch, or review a campaign.*

## SECTION 1: Strategic Clarity Check

*(From Universal Principles)*

Before touching a platform, confirm:

- [ ] I can state what this ad is filtering for, not selling
- [ ] This ad moves the user one step, not the whole funnel
- [ ] I know whether this is an interruption or invitation ad
- [ ] The ad targets one awareness level only (Unaware / Problem-aware / Solution-aware / Product-aware / Most-aware)
- [ ] The message has one core promise
- [ ] The CTA matches the audience's mindset
- [ ] I can clearly articulate the cost of inaction
- [ ] Differentiation is based on framing, not features

**If unclear here, stop. Ads amplify confusion.**

## SECTION 2: Funnel Alignment Check

*(Creative Selection Starts With Funnel Stage)*

- [ ] This campaign is clearly: TOFU (attention + problem recognition) / MOFU (belief + preference) / BOFU (friction removal + action)
- [ ] The creative type matches the funnel stage
- [ ] I am not running BOFU creatives to cold traffic
- [ ] I can explain what belief must change next

## SECTION 3: Creative Strategy Check

*(Creative Types by Strategic Role)*

For each creative in the campaign:

- [ ] I know the strategic role of this creative (Pain point / Cost of inaction / Product demo / How-to / Testimonial / Case study / Founder story / Category framing / Objection handling / Thought leadership / Interview / Lifestyle / Meme)
- [ ] I know why this format is chosen, not just that it "works"
- [ ] The structure follows the correct pattern for that creative type
- [ ] The platform is a natural fit for this creative
- [ ] I am not forcing a format onto the wrong platform

## SECTION 4A: Campaign Structure & Setup Check

*(Recommended Campaign Structure by Platform)*

**Meta:**
- [ ] One campaign = one objective
- [ ] 1-3 ad sets max during testing phase
- [ ] 3-6 ads per ad set
- [ ] Budget not fragmented across too many ad sets
- [ ] CBO vs ABO decision is intentional

**LinkedIn:**
- [ ] One campaign = one audience hypothesis
- [ ] No over-layered targeting
- [ ] 3-5 differentiated ads
- [ ] Awareness and retargeting separated

**Google Search:**
- [ ] Brand and non-brand separated
- [ ] One ad group = one keyword theme (4-6 keywords)
- [ ] 1-2 RSAs per ad group
- [ ] Headline mirrors keyword intent

**Universal:**
- [ ] Each testing cell has enough budget
- [ ] If budget is small, simplify structure
- [ ] If results are messy, fix structure before changing creative

## SECTION 4B: Platform Fit Check

*(Platform-Specific Playbooks)*

Before launch, confirm:

- [ ] I understand the platform mindset
- [ ] I understand the buyer intent reality
- [ ] The campaign type matches what the platform actually does
- [ ] Creative matches platform-native behavior
- [ ] Specs (dimensions, length, text limits) are correct
- [ ] I reviewed real ads in the platform's ads library

If this feels like "Meta but resized," it is wrong.

## SECTION 5: Tracking & Attribution Check

*(Tracking, Attribution & Signal Integrity)*

**Tracking Setup:**
- [ ] Pixel / base tag installed correctly
- [ ] Conversion API (CAPI) active and deduplicated
- [ ] Events are firing and verified
- [ ] Domains verified where required

**Web vs App:**
- [ ] Web events originate from site + CAPI
- [ ] App events originate from Appsflyer / Adjust (MMP)
- [ ] Platforms receive app events from the MMP, not independently

**Events:**
- [ ] TOFU events track meaningful engagement
- [ ] MOFU events reflect intent
- [ ] BOFU events represent real value
- [ ] Conversion values are assigned where possible

**Attribution:**
- [ ] Platform attribution used for optimization
- [ ] Analytics used for decision-making
- [ ] MMP used as authority for app spend
- [ ] I am watching directional trends, not perfection

Never scale on broken tracking.

## SECTION 6: Operational Execution Check

*(How campaigns are run day to day)*

**Testing:**
- [ ] I am testing one variable at a time
- [ ] Testing priority follows: Message → Creative format → Audience → Bidding
- [ ] Learning objective is defined before launch

**Kill Rules:**
- [ ] Kill thresholds are set
- [ ] I will not keep ads "because they might work later"

**Scaling:**
- [ ] Scaling only after signal stability
- [ ] Budget increases capped at 20-30%
- [ ] I will not edit winning creatives

**Creative Refresh:**
- [ ] TOFU refresh cadence planned
- [ ] MOFU refresh cadence planned
- [ ] BOFU refresh cadence planned

**Signal Reading:**
- [ ] I know how to diagnose CTR vs CVR vs CPA
- [ ] I won't misattribute landing page issues to ads

## SECTION 7: Scaling & System Check

*(Scalable Growth OS)*

- [ ] Budget is allocated by funnel stage
- [ ] Platforms are sequenced, not siloed
- [ ] Learning is transferred across platforms
- [ ] Creative insights are centralized
- [ ] One owner exists per message, not per platform

Paid media scales when learning compounds.
