# Performance Marketing Playbook

## Overview

This playbook provides a complete framework for planning, executing, and optimizing paid advertising campaigns across all major platforms. It covers universal principles, creative strategy, platform-specific tactics, tracking, and operational execution.

---

## Section 1: Universal Principles of High-Performing Ads

Everything else in this playbook only works if these principles are understood and applied correctly. Paid advertising is not primarily about creativity. It is about attention, relevance, timing, and belief transfer.

### What an Ad Is (and What It Is Not)

An ad is not a salesperson. An ad is a filter.

**Its job is to:**
- Interrupt attention
- Qualify the right audience
- Move the right person one step forward

**Its job is NOT to:**
- Explain everything
- Convince skeptics
- Close complex purchases

Most ads fail because they attempt to compress the entire buyer journey into a single impression.

### The Attention Reality

Every platform is an attention marketplace. You are competing with friends, entertainment, news, work messages, and habit.

**This means:**
- Attention is borrowed, not given
- You must earn it immediately
- You do not get warm-up time

If your ad does not create a reason to stop within the first 1-2 seconds on feed-based platforms or the first headline on search, it will not be seen.

### Interruption vs Invitation

**Interruption Ads** stop the scroll by force:
- Bold claims
- Pattern breaks
- Strong opinions
- Visual disruption

Best for: Cold audiences, feed-based platforms, awareness and consideration

**Invitation Ads** invite attention because intent already exists:
- Keyword-matched copy
- Problem-aware messaging
- Clear relevance signals

Best for: Search, retargeting, high-intent users

### Audience Awareness Levels

Every ad should be written for one awareness level, not all of them.

| Level | What They Know | Creative Approach |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Unaware | Don't know they have a problem | Stories, patterns, lifestyle, education |
| Problem-Aware | Feel the pain but don't know the solution | Pain articulation and reframing |
| Solution-Aware | Know solutions exist but not which one | Differentiation and category framing |
| Product-Aware | Know you but are undecided | Proof, objections, reassurance |
| Most-Aware | Ready to act | Urgency, offer clarity, friction removal |

### The Universal Ad Anatomy

Every high-performing ad contains the same core components:

1. **Hook** - Earns attention. Audience-first, not brand-first. One idea only. Specific beats clever.

2. **Context and Relatability** - Where belief begins. Describe the situation, not the solution. Use the audience's language.

3. **Value Proposition** - Answers "Why should I care?" One promise per ad. Outcome over features.

4. **Proof and Credibility** - Reduces risk. Numbers, screenshots, testimonials, authority.

5. **Offer** - Answers "What happens if I click?" Match offer to intent level.

6. **CTA** - Directs action. One action only. Low commitment beats aggressive selling for cold traffic.

### Cost of Inaction

One of the most underused levers in paid ads. Instead of only asking "What do I get if I act?" also answer "What does it cost if I don't?" This reframes urgency without discounts or pressure.

### Functional, Emotional, and Financial Benefits

Strong ads communicate value on three levels:

- **Functional** - What the product does (saves time, automates tasks, reduces errors)
- **Emotional** - How it makes the user feel (confident, in control, relieved)
- **Financial** - What it saves or earns (reduces cost, increases revenue, avoids waste)

High-performing ads lead with one and reinforce with the others.

### Differentiation and Category Framing

Differentiation means framing the problem differently, naming a tradeoff others ignore, owning a point of view. Often how you explain the problem is more differentiating than the solution itself.

### Why Good Ads Still Fail

- Wrong audience awareness level
- Weak or unclear offer
- Landing page mismatch
- Platform-native rules ignored
- Insufficient budget for learning

### The Golden Rule

If an ad is not working, assume the problem is clarity before creativity. Fix the message before fixing the design.

### Section 1 Quick Reference

| Principle | What It Means in Practice | Common Failure Mode | Correction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ads are filters, not closers | The ad moves the right person one step forward | Trying to explain everything in one ad | Narrow the message to one belief shift |
| Attention is borrowed | You must earn attention instantly | Slow intros, branding first | Lead with audience pain or disruption |
| Interruption vs invitation | Match creative to intent level | Using soft copy in feeds or hype in search | Align tone to platform behavior |
| Awareness levels matter | One ad = one awareness level | Mixing education, proof, and CTA together | Segment ads by awareness stage |
| One core promise per ad | Outcome beats features | Feature dumping | Choose the single strongest outcome |
| Proof reduces risk | Belief comes from evidence | Claims without validation | Add numbers, screenshots, voices |
| CTA must match mindset | Low friction wins cold traffic | "Book a demo" too early | Step down the commitment |
| Functional, emotional, financial value | Strong ads signal value on multiple levels | Only talking features or price | Lead with one, reinforce others |
| Cost of inaction creates urgency | Delay has consequences | Relying on fake urgency | Show real tradeoffs |
| Differentiation is framing | How you explain the problem matters | Sounding interchangeable | Own a POV |
| Ads amplify clarity | Ads don't fix weak positioning | Tweaking creatives endlessly | Fix message before design |

---

## Section 2: Creative Strategy Guide

Creative strategy answers three questions:
- What does the audience already believe?
- What must change in their mind next?
- What format best causes that shift on this platform?

### Funnel Stage Framework

| Stage | Goal | Audience State | Creative Must Do | Avoid |
|-------|------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| TOFU (Cold) | Create recognition and curiosity | Busy, distracted, skeptical, not shopping | Interrupt attention, name the problem, reframe | Selling, feature lists |
| MOFU (Warm) | Build belief and preference | Curious, comparing options, evaluating credibility | Demonstrate value, reduce uncertainty, differentiate | Over-educating without proof |
| BOFU (Hot) | Remove friction, prompt action | Interested, risk-aware, close to deciding | Address objections, reinforce proof, make action feel safe | Introducing new concepts |

---

## Section 3: Creative Types by Strategic Role

### 1. Pain Point Ads
- **When:** Cold audiences, problem-aware users, feed-based platforms
- **Role:** Create relevance by signaling "this is about you"

- **Structure:** Old way vs new way, tradeoffs, why it matters
- **Best on:** LinkedIn, Meta, Reddit

### 9. Objection Handling Ads
- **When:** Bottom of funnel, retargeting
- **Role:** Remove final mental blockers
- **Common objections:** Price, time, complexity, risk
- **Best on:** LinkedIn, Meta retargeting, Google Display

### 10. Thought Leader / Expertise Ads

### Creative Rotation Rules

- Cold creative: refresh every 2-4 weeks
- Retargeting creative: rotate weekly
- Never change creative and targeting at the same time

Signals of fatigue: Rising CPM, falling CTR, stable conversion rate.

### Creative Matching Reminder

- Meta rewards native-looking content
- LinkedIn rewards clarity and credibility
- TikTok rewards authenticity and speed
- Google Search rewards relevance, not persuasion
- Reddit rewards respect for context

Creative strategy is translation, not duplication.

## Section 4: Platform-Specific Playbooks

### Google Ads (Search)

**Mindset:** Demand capture, not demand creation. Relevance and clarity over persuasion.

**Buyer Intent:** Problem-aware or solution-aware, actively comparing options

**When It Works Best:**
- Clear, high-intent queries exist
- Problem can be expressed in words
- Commercial intent behind keywords

**When It Fails:**
- Category is new or undefined
- Users don't know what to search
- Product requires heavy education

**Campaign Types:**

| Campaign Type | What It's For | What It's Not For |
|---|---|---|
| Search | High-intent lead or sales capture | Awareness or storytelling |
| Performance Max | Incremental reach + retargeting support | Primary learning channel |

**Ad Structure (Responsive Search Ads):**
- 1 ad group = 1 intent theme
- 4-6 keywords max per ad group
- 15 headlines, 4 descriptions
- Headline 1: Keyword mirror
- Headline 2: Primary benefit
- Headline 3: CTA or qualifier

**What Works:** Exact and phrase match, clear qualifiers, strong landing page alignment

**What Fails:** Generic value propositions, clever but vague headlines, broad match without negatives

**Specs:** Headlines 30 chars, Descriptions 90 chars

**Bidding Progression:**
1. Maximize Clicks (data collection)
2. Maximize Conversions (after 15-30 conversions)
3. Target CPA/ROAS (after 50+ conversions)

Do not jump to automated bidding without conversion data.

## Section 5: Tracking & Attribution

### Core Tracking Components

| Layer | Purpose | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Pixel / Base Tag | Page-level behavior tracking | Meta Pixel, Google Tag, LinkedIn Insight Tag |
| Event Tracking | Key actions and intent signals | View content, add to cart, lead, purchase |
| Conversion API (CAPI) | Server-side reliability | Meta CAPI, Google Enhanced Conversions |
| Mobile Attribution (MMP) | Install attribution, fraud control | Appsflyer, Adjust |
| Analytics Layer | Cross-channel truth | GA4, Amplitude, Mixpanel |

### Platform Pixels and Tags

| Platform | Tracking Tool | What It Feeds the Algorithm |
|---|---|---|
| Google | Google Tag + Enhanced Conversions | Keyword intent and conversion value |
| Meta | Meta Pixel + Conversions API | Behavioral optimization signals |
| LinkedIn | Insight Tag | Professional intent and retargeting |
| TikTok | TikTok Pixel + Events API | Creative engagement signals |
| Reddit | Reddit Pixel | Click and conversion feedback |
| X | X Pixel | Engagement and site actions |
| Snapchat | Snap Pixel | Mobile behavior and purchases |
| Mobile Apps | Appsflyer / Adjust (MMP) | Install attribution, post-install events, fraud-filtered signals |

Rule: Pixels alone are no longer sufficient. Server-side tracking (CAPI, Enhanced Conversions) is required for reliable signal delivery.

### Event Design

Track meaningful intent, not everything.

| Funnel Stage | Events |
|--------------|--------|
| TOFU | View content, scroll depth |
| MOFU | Product views, pricing views |
| BOFU | Lead, demo, purchase |

Assign conversion values, even if estimated. Platforms optimize better with value signals.

### Attribution Models

| Model | Best Use | Risk |
|-------|----------|------|
| Last Click | High-intent capture | Undervalues discovery |
| First Click | Awareness evaluation | Overcredits early touch |
| Data-Driven | Mature accounts | Needs volume |
| Platform-Reported | Optimization feedback | Over-credits itself |

**Operating rule:**
- Use platform attribution to optimize delivery
- Use analytics attribution to decide spend
- Use MMP attribution to decide app spend

### Validation Checklist

Before scaling:
- Pixel installed on all pages
- Events firing correctly
- CAPI active and deduplicated
- Conversions appearing in ad platforms
- Analytics numbers directionally aligned
- MMP SDK installed correctly (mobile)
- Events deduplicated between MMP and platform

Never scale on broken tracking.

### Dealing With Attribution Gaps

Expect under-reporting due to iOS privacy (ATT, SKAdNetwork), ad blockers, and cross-device journeys.

**Practical responses:**
- Use blended metrics: MER (Marketing Efficiency Ratio) = Total Revenue / Total Ad Spend
- Watch directional movement, not absolute numbers
- Compare pre vs post exposure windows
- Use MMP cohorts for app spend decisions

### The Signal Quality Rule

Bad data trains platforms to find the wrong people. Signal quality is the foundation of algorithmic optimization. For web, signal quality is controlled by event design and CAPI. For apps, it is controlled by the MMP.

If lead quality drops: check event definitions, tighten conversion criteria, feed higher-quality signals upstream.

---

## Section 6: Operational Execution

### Testing Priority Stack

Test in this order:
1. **Message** - Hook, pain articulation, value proposition
2. **Creative format** - Video vs static, demo vs POV vs testimonial
3. **Audience** - Cold vs warm, broad vs narrow
4. **Bidding** - Only after creative and message are validated

Change one variable at a time. Never change creative and targeting in the same test cycle.

### Kill Rules

Kill an ad if:
- CTR is 40-60% below account average after learning
- CPC is rising while CTR is falling
- Engagement drops but frequency rises

Time-based:
- Cold ads: review after 3-5 days
- Retargeting ads: review after 48-72 hours

### Scale Rules

Scale only when:
- CTR is stable or improving
- CPA is within target range
- Conversion rate is consistent

Safe scaling:
- Increase budget by 20-30% every 48 hours
- Duplicate winning ads into new audiences
- Expand placement, not message

Avoid:
- Doubling budgets overnight
- Editing winning creatives

### Creative Refresh Cadence

| Funnel Stage | Refresh |
|--------------|---------|
| TOFU | Every 2-4 weeks |
| MOFU | Every 1-2 weeks |
| BOFU | Weekly or bi-weekly |

### Signal Interpretation

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| High CTR, low conversions | Landing page mismatch | Fix LP, not ads |
| Low CTR, high CVR | Weak hook | Rewrite hook |
| Rising CPA, stable CTR | Auction pressure | Improve differentiation |
| Flat performance | Creative fatigue | Refresh angle |

### Recommended Campaign Structure by Platform

Campaign structure determines how clean your data is, how fast you learn, how efficiently budgets scale, and whether insights compound or fragment.

#### A. Meta (Facebook & Instagram)

**Hierarchy:** Campaign → Ad Set → Ads

**Recommended Baseline Setup (Testing Phase):**

**Campaign Level:**
- 1 campaign per funnel objective (e.g., TOFU Campaign with Sales/Leads objective, BOFU Retargeting Campaign)

**Ad Set Level:**
- 1-3 ad sets max per campaign during testing
- Each ad set = one audience hypothesis (Broad, Lookalike, Interest stack, Retargeting segment)
- Do not create 10+ ad sets unless budget justifies it

**Ad Level:**
- 3-6 ads per ad set
- Each ad tests a different hook or a different angle (not random creative variations)

**Budget Guidance:**
- Use CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization) once signal is clear
- Use ABO (Ad Set Budget Optimization) during early testing

**Structural Rule:** Too many ad sets = budget fragmentation. Too few ads = no creative testing. Too many ads = weak signal per creative.

#### B. LinkedIn Ads

**Hierarchy:** Campaign Group → Campaign → Ads

**Recommended Baseline Setup:**

**Campaign Group:** Separate by objective or region

**Campaign Level:**
- 1 campaign per funnel stage or offer
- Avoid mixing TOFU and BOFU in same campaign

**Audience Targeting:**
- 1 audience per campaign during testing (Job title cluster, Industry + seniority, Account list/ABM)
- Do not layer too many filters early

**Ad Level:**
- 3-5 ads per campaign
- Clear angle differentiation: Pain framing, Case study, Thought leadership

**Structural Rule:** Narrow audiences need stronger creative rotation. Budget fragmentation hurts more because CPC is higher.

#### C. Google Ads (Search)

**Hierarchy:** Account → Campaign → Ad Group → Ads

**Recommended Baseline Setup:**

**Campaign Level:**
- 1 campaign per core intent category, match type strategy, or geography
- Do not mix brand + non-brand, or high intent + exploratory keywords

**Ad Group Level:**
- 1 ad group = 1 keyword theme
- 4-6 closely related keywords max
- Do not group unrelated terms for convenience

**Ad Level:**
- 1-2 Responsive Search Ads per ad group
- Each RSA: H1 = keyword mirror, H2 = benefit, H3 = qualifier or CTA

**Structural Rule:** Structure is more important than creative volume. Intent clarity beats variation quantity.

#### D. Quick Comparison Table

| Platform | Structure | Testing Focus | Common Mistake |
|---|---|---|---|
| Meta | Campaign → Ad Set → Ads | Creative volume + audience hypothesis | Too many ad sets |
| LinkedIn | Campaign Group → Campaign → Ads | Message clarity | Over-narrow targeting |
| Google Search | Campaign → Ad Group → Ads | Intent clustering | Mixing unrelated keywords |

#### E. Universal Structural Rules

- One campaign = one primary objective
- One ad set/ad group = one audience or intent hypothesis
- Ads inside should test message, not random visuals
- Budget must be sufficient per testing cell
- If budget per test cell is too low, structure must simplify

**Final Structural Principle:** Structure determines signal quality. Signal quality determines scaling speed. If learning is slow, check structure before blaming creative.

## Section 7: Scalable Growth

### Budget Allocation by Funnel Stage

**Early Stage:**
- BOFU (Search, Retargeting): 40-50%
- MOFU (Demos, Education): 30-35%
- TOFU (Awareness): 15-25%

**Growth Stage:** TOFU grows to feed MOFU as data stabilizes.

### Cross-Platform Sequencing

Platforms are sequential, not parallel:

1. **Meta / TikTok** - Create awareness and demand signals
2. **YouTube / LinkedIn** - Educate and build trust
3. **Google Search** - Capture demand
4. **Retargeting everywhere** - Reinforce belief and remove friction

### Learning Transfer

**What transfers well:**
- Hooks
- Pain language
- Objections
- Proof formats

**What does not transfer:**
- Visual styles
- Length
- Tone

A winning Meta hook becomes a Google headline, LinkedIn opening line, and YouTube opening statement.

### Avoiding Platform Silos

- One shared creative library
- Weekly cross-platform review
- One owner per message, not per platform

Platforms execute differently. Strategy stays centralized.
