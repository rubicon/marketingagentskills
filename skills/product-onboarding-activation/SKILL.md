| Key activation event | The "aha moment" that indicates a user has found value |
| Key features that drive activation | Features most correlated with retention |
| Current onboarding channels | Email, in-app, sales, CSM, etc. |
| Known onboarding issues | Existing friction points or churn signals (if any) |

---

## Onboarding Goals Framework

The goals of onboarding center on setting new customers up for success and ensuring they see value quickly. Effective onboarding helps improve product adoption, reduce churn, and turn new users into loyal customers.

### Key Goals of Onboarding

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Accelerate Time to Value (TTV) | Help users quickly experience the "aha moment" or core value of the product |
| Drive Product Adoption | Guide users to activate key features and develop usage habits that lead to retention |
| Educate Users | Teach users how to use the product effectively through tutorials, tooltips, emails, and in-app messages |
| Build User Confidence & Trust | Reduce friction and uncertainty by offering support, resources, and reassurance |
| Gather Feedback & Improve UX | Use onboarding as an opportunity to learn about pain points, collect data, and optimize the experience |
| Reduce Support Burden | Minimize user support tickets by proactively solving common problems in the onboarding journey |
| Boost Customer Retention & Satisfaction | A strong onboarding experience increases the likelihood of long-term engagement |
| Drive Expansion or Upsell Opportunities | As users become engaged and successful, onboarding opens the door to feature upgrades or premium plans |

## Lifecycle Framework: Four Phases

### Phase 1: Meet & Greet

Establish the relationship and set expectations.

| Step | Theme | Reason | Timeline | Channel |
|------|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Introduce yourself | Get the relationship off to a good start. First impressions count. If taking over from sales, introduce the new point of contact (you, Account Manager, or CSM). | Immediate | Email |
| 2 | Give a warm welcome | Guide users into the next stage of setup. Personalize with name, company, and plan type. Set expectations for what's coming. | Immediate | In-app |

### Phase 2: Use More

Drive activation and feature adoption.

| Step | Theme | Reason | Timeline | Channel |
|------|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| 3 | Provide step-by-step support | Create walkthrough messages or video tutorials explaining where everything is and how to make the most of features. | Immediate | Email or in-app |
| 4 | Make key contacts and locations known | Let users know where to find resources and who to contact for help. Prevent silent suffering. | Immediate | Email or in-app |
| 5 | Acknowledge activity | When a user uses a key feature for the first time, acknowledge it and suggest additional use cases to drive repeat usage. | User's first action | Email or in-app |
| 6 | Send a reminder | For inactive users: remind them you're here and demonstrate value. For active users who haven't used key features: "Did you know you can also..." | Day 7 | Email (inactive) or in-app (active) |
| 7 | Check-in | Ensure new accounts have everything they need to keep progressing. | Day 10 | Email |

### Phase 3: Churn Less

Retain users and prevent disengagement.

| Step | Theme | Reason | Timeline | Channel |
|------|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| 8 | Tactical feature messages | Feed users with relevant, contextual how-to content. Drive ongoing adoption and continually deliver value. These are ongoing, not one-off. | Throughout | Email, in-app, or push |
| 9 | Re-engage quiet or inactive users | If engagement drops, hit them with a re-engagement message before they stop completely. Don't wait until full churn. | Week 2+ | Email, targeted social ad, phone call |
| 10 | How are we doing? | Gauge how new users are finding the product. Use results to determine next steps and segment users. | Week 4 | Email or in-app |

### Phase 4: Buy More

Drive expansion and advocacy.

| Step | Theme | Reason | Timeline | Channel |
|------|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| 11 | Up or cross-sell | Tease freemium and paid accounts with what they could achieve by upgrading or purchasing complementary products. | Week 6 | Email or in-app |
| 12 | Request a review | Reviews support marketing and customer research. Exclude users who expressed displeasure in Step 10. | Week 8 | Email or in-app |

## Onboarding Audit Framework

When auditing an existing onboarding experience, evaluate these areas:

### What Currently Exists (Baseline Audit)

**Sign-Up Experience**
- How easy is it to create an account?
- What fields are required? Is SSO available?

**First-Time User Experience (FTUE)**
- Is there a welcome message or setup guide?
- What does the user see on first login?

**Guided Onboarding or Tutorials**
- Are there walkthroughs, checklists, tooltips?
- Is there a clear path to the "aha moment"?

**Emails & Messaging**
- Are onboarding emails sent? How relevant/helpful are they?
- Are there nudges or reminders if inactive?

**Support Touchpoints**
- Is there access to live chat, help docs, or community?
- Are there prompts to book a call or talk to support?

**Progress Indicators**
- Is progress tracked visually?
- Are there milestones or checklists?

### Where Gaps Exist (Friction Points & Missed Opportunities)

Identify:
- Where users feel stuck, confused, or lost
- Where the value proposition is unclear or delayed
- Where Time to Value takes too long
- Where users don't understand what to do next
- Where critical features are hidden or underutilized
- Where personalization or persona-tailored flows are missing

---

## PMM Evaluation Lenses

Apply these lenses when evaluating onboarding:

| Lens | Question |
|------|----------|
| Time to Value | How quickly do users reach the core product benefit? |
| Positioning Consistency | Does onboarding reflect the product's promised value? |
| Segmentation | Are flows personalized for user types or use cases? |
| Retention Enablement | Are users set up for long-term success? |
