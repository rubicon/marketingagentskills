### Production Notes
- **Music / mood:** No music for the first 22 seconds. Let the founder's voice and story carry. Subtle, warm ambient music from 0:22 onward.
- **Sound effects:** Phone notification (0:30 when email arrives), keyboard typing (0:24), none in the opening
- **Pacing:** Slow, personal. Follow the founder's natural speech. This is not a pitch. It is a story.
- **Brand constraints:** Must be the real founder. No script teleprompter. Use bullet point notes and let them talk naturally.
- **Reference links:** [Founder's LinkedIn for credibility context], [Early product screenshots]
- **Variations needed:** 1:1 for feed, 60-second extended cut with more detail on the "why"

### 8. Us vs Them / Category Framing Ad

**When to use:** Competitive markets, educated buyers comparing options
**Strategic role:** Define the decision criteria so the buyer evaluates on your terms
**Default hook style:** Old way vs new way contrast
**Audio approach:** VO-driven, confident and slightly provocative
**Recommended b-roll:** Split screen comparisons, competitor UIs (blurred), side-by-side workflows

#### Worked Example: Us vs Them Ad

```
## Video Script Brief

### Creative Brief
- **Creative type:** Us vs Them / Category Framing
- **Funnel stage:** MOFU
- **Platform:** Meta + LinkedIn
- **Awareness level:** Solution-aware
- **Duration:** 30 seconds
- **Aspect ratio:** 1:1

### Concept
- **Video idea:** Contrast the old way of reporting (BI tools that require analysts, spreadsheets that require manual updates) with the new way (DataFlow: self-serve, auto-updating, no SQL).
- **Core angle:** The decision is not "DataFlow or not." It is "modern reporting or legacy reporting."
- **One-line promise:** See the difference between how marketing teams used to report and how the best ones do it now.

### Hook (0:00 - 0:03)
- **Hook type:** Old way vs new way
- **Hook line:** "This is how most teams build reports. And this is how the fastest-growing teams do it."
- **Visual:** Split screen: left side (cluttered spreadsheet, gray tone), right side (clean dashboard, bright)
- **Audio:** VO, confident
- **Text overlay:** Left: "The old way" / Right: "The new way"

### Body

| Timestamp | Script / VO | On-Screen Visual | B-Roll | Text Overlay | Sound / Music |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 0:03-0:10 | "The old way: export CSVs, paste into slides, wait for the analyst to build the dashboard, update it all again next week." | Left side animates: CSV download, paste into Sheets, email to analyst, repeat arrow | Hands copy-pasting, clock spinning | "Export. Paste. Wait. Repeat." | Slightly dull, monotone music on left |
| 0:10-0:18 | "The new way: connect once, pick your metrics, and the report updates itself. No SQL. No analysts. No Sunday night prep." | Right side animates: one-click connect, dashboard populates, auto-scheduled | Clean UI, Slack notification, person relaxing | "Connect. Pick. Done." | Bright, modern music on right |
| 0:18-0:25 | "Same data. Same tools. Completely different experience." | Both sides visible, then right side expands to full frame | Product UI fills the screen | "Same data. Better experience." | Music resolves to confident |

### CTA (0:25 - 0:30)
- **CTA line:** "See the difference. Try DataFlow free."
- **Visual:** End card
- **End card:** DataFlow logo, "dataflow.io/compare", "See the difference"
- **Audio:** VO delivers CTA

### Production Notes
- **Music / mood:** Dual tone. Left side: slightly dated, corporate elevator music. Right side: modern, clean electronic. The contrast should be felt, not just seen.
- **Sound effects:** Old computer processing sound on left (0:05), error beep (0:08), clean whoosh on right (0:12), success chime (0:16)
- **Pacing:** Matched cuts. Each "old way" beat is immediately contrasted with a "new way" beat. Mirror structure.
- **Brand constraints:** Never name competitors directly. Use "the old way" / "legacy tools" / "traditional BI." Blur any competitor logos.
- **Reference links:** [Competitor UI screenshots (blurred)], [DataFlow comparison page]
- **Variations needed:** Vertical 9:16 (stack top/bottom instead of left/right), static image version with side-by-side
```

- **Awareness level:** Product-aware
- **Duration:** 15 seconds

It is the automation layer that feeds your BI tool clean data on a schedule." | Simple animated diagram: Data sources → DataFlow → Looker/Tableau/Sheets | Product UI showing integrations list with BI tools | "Not a BI tool. The layer before it." | Clean, minimal music |
| 0:08-0:12 | "Keep Looker. Keep Sheets. Let DataFlow do the part nobody wants to do." | Product UI: scheduled data sync running, green checkmarks | Person closing their laptop at 5 PM | "Keep your tools. Lose the busywork." | Music stays light |

### CTA (0:12 - 0:15)
- **CTA line:** "Works with what you already use. Try free."
- **Visual:** End card with integration logos (Looker, Tableau, Sheets, BigQuery)

- **Audio:** VO delivers CTA

### Production Notes

- **Sound effects:** Marker writing sound (0:01), subtle connection sound when diagram shows data flowing (0:05)
- **Pacing:** Quick. 15 seconds. Every second counts. No filler.
- **Brand constraints:** Name competitor tools respectfully (Looker, Tableau). Position as complementary, not competitive.
- **Reference links:** [Integration page], [FAQ about BI tool compatibility]
- **Variations needed:** "Too expensive" objection version, "Too complex to set up" objection version, "Our team won't adopt it" version
```

### Body

| Timestamp | Script / VO | On-Screen Visual | B-Roll | Text Overlay | Sound / Music |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 0:03-0:10 | "I have seen teams with 12 dashboards and no idea which channel is actually driving revenue. More data does not mean better decisions." | Speaker continues | Dashboard with too many widgets, person squinting at screen | "12 dashboards. Zero clarity." | No music. Voice only. |
| 0:10-0:18 | "The teams that win do three things: they pick fewer metrics, they automate the collection, and they spend their time on interpretation, not assembly." | Speaker, then transition to animated three-step diagram | Whiteboard with "fewer metrics → automate → interpret" | "1. Fewer metrics. 2. Automate. 3. Interpret." | Very subtle ambient music starts |
| 0:18-0:25 | "We built DataFlow around this idea. Less time assembling. More time deciding." | Speaker for first half, product UI for second half | Product dashboard, simple and clean | "Less assembly. More decisions." | Music present but quiet |

- **Pacing:** Conversational but deliberate. Pauses between key statements for emphasis.
- **Brand constraints:** Speaker must be a real company leader (VP, CMO, founder). No actors. Authentic setting.

| Timestamp | Script / VO | On-Screen Visual | B-Roll | Text Overlay | Sound / Music |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 0:03-0:15 | Interviewer: "Why reporting specifically?" CMO: "Because it takes skilled people and gives them the work of an intern. You are paying $120K a year for someone to copy-paste numbers." | Two-camera interview: wide shot, then close-up on CMO | Office setting, team at desks | "$120K/year for copy-paste work" | No music. Interview audio only. |
| 0:15-0:25 | CMO: "The best marketing teams I have worked with automated reporting completely.

## Direct-Response Hook Options

Any creative type can use a financial/data hook from the direct-response approach. Here are the formulas adapted for video:

| Formula | Video Hook Example |
|---------|-------------------|
| "The Market Is Paying $X for [Skill]" | Open with the number as text on screen, VO reads it |
| "[X]% of [Professionals] Say [Thing]. Only [Y]% Can Prove It." | Animated stat builds on screen |
| "[Professionals] with [Skill] Earn [X]% More." | Number appears large, then zooms out to show context |
| "Companies Hiring [Role] at $[X]." | Job listing screenshots scroll, salary highlighted |

These work especially well in Cost of Inaction, Pain Point, and Thought Leader creative types, but can open any video when you have strong financial data.
