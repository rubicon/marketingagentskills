```

### 2. Cost of Inaction Ad

**When to use:** Warm audiences, consideration stage
**Default visual approach:** Large number as the focal point. Data-driven design. The number should hit before the context.
**Recommended headline formula:** "$[X] is what [pain] costs your team per year." or "[X] hours lost to [problem] every [time period]."

```

```

### Production Notes
- **Brand constraints:** Steps 1-2 are generic and educational. Only step 3 introduces the product. This is intentional. Do not brand all three steps.
- **Reference images:** LinkedIn infographic posts, educational carousel first slides, HubSpot "how-to" social graphics.
- **What to avoid:** Too many steps (max 3-4 for a single image). Clip art icons. Steps that are too wordy.

```

**Typical composition:** Two-column split with clear visual contrast. Left side: muted, dull, complex. Right side: bright, clean, simple.

#### Worked Example: Us vs Them Image Ad

```
## Single Image Creative Brief

### Creative Brief

- **Funnel stage:** MOFU
- **Platform:** Meta + LinkedIn
- **Placement:** Feed
- **Dimensions:** 1080x1080 (1:1)

### Concept
- **Angle:** Old way vs new way of marketing reporting. Reframe the category.
- **Core message:** The choice is not between tools. It is between manual reporting and automated reporting.
- **Emotional tone:** Confident contrast. Not attacking competitors. Reframing the category.

### Copy
- **Headline (left):** "The Old Way"
- **Headline (right):** "The New Way"
- **Supporting text (left):** "Export CSVs. Paste into slides. Wait for the analyst. Do it again next week."
- **Supporting text (right):** "Connect once. Pick metrics. Reports build themselves. No SQL."
- **CTA text:** "See the difference →"

### Visual Direction
- **Primary visual:** Side-by-side comparison. Left: cluttered, gray. Right: clean, blue.
- **Composition:** Perfect 50/50 split. Left column: "The Old Way" with gray/muted treatment. Right column: "The New Way" with DataFlow blue/clean treatment. Headline at top spanning both. CTA at bottom spanning both.
- **Color palette / mood:** Left side: gray (#e0e0e0 background), muted text, dull feel. Right side: white or light blue background, DataFlow blue accent, clean and bright. The contrast should be felt immediately.
- **Typography direction:** Same font both sides (consistency). But left side text in gray, right side text in dark/blue.

### Elements

- **Foreground subject:** Text lists on each side. Optional: small icons for each bullet point.

- **Overlays / graphics:** Check marks (green) in the right column. X marks (red/gray) in the left column. Vertical divider line between columns. Optional: subtle arrow pointing from left to right.

### Production Notes
- **Brand constraints:** Never name competitors directly. Use "the old way," "legacy tools," "traditional BI." Do not use competitor logos or colors.
- **Reference images:** Monday.com comparison ads. Notion vs Confluence style comparisons.
- **What to avoid:** More than 4 bullet points per side. Naming specific competitors. Making the left side look intentionally ugly (it should look dated, not deliberately bad).
- **Variations needed:** 1200x627 landscape for LinkedIn, 9:16 (stack top/bottom instead of left/right).
```

---

### 9. Objection Handling Ad

**When to use:** Bottom of funnel, retargeting audiences who visited but did not convert
**Default visual approach:** Quote the objection directly as the headline, then address it.
**Recommended headline formula:** "'[Objection].' [Response]." or "Think [Product] is [objection]? Here's the truth."
**Typical composition:** Objection text large at top (in quotes). Response below. Clean, direct, no imagery needed.

- **Placement:** Feed
- **Dimensions:** 1080x1080 (1:1)

### Concept
- **Angle:** Address the #1 objection directly: "We already have a BI tool."
- **Core message:** DataFlow is not a BI replacement. It is the automation layer that feeds your BI tool.
- **Emotional tone:** Calm, reassuring, clarifying (not defensive)

### Copy
- **Headline:** "'We already have Looker.'"
- **Supporting text:** "Great. Keep it. DataFlow isn't a BI tool. It's the automation layer that feeds Looker clean data on a schedule."
- **CTA text:** "Works with your stack →"

### Visual Direction
- **Primary visual:** Text-driven. The objection in quotes is the visual hook.
- **Composition:** Objection quote large at top (handwritten style or in quote marks). Response below in clean body text. Integration logos at bottom with CTA.
- **Color palette / mood:** Clean white background. Objection text in dark gray. Response text in black. CTA in DataFlow blue.
- **Typography direction:** Handwritten or italic serif for the objection quote (makes it feel like a real comment someone made). Clean sans-serif for the response.

### Elements
- **Background:** White or very light gray.
- **Foreground subject:** Text.
- **Text placement:** Objection: top 40%, large. Response: middle 40%. Integration logos + CTA: bottom 20%.
- **Logo placement:** DataFlow logo small, bottom-right. Integration logos (Looker, Tableau, Sheets) in a row above the CTA.
- **Overlays / graphics:** Large quotation marks around the objection. Small green checkmarks next to each integration logo.

### Production Notes
- **Brand constraints:** Name competitor tools respectfully (Looker, Tableau). Position as complementary. Professional tone.
- **Reference images:** FAQ-style social cards. Basecamp's "compared to" marketing.
- **What to avoid:** Defensive language. Disparaging competitors. Complex diagrams.
- **Variations needed:** "Too expensive" objection version, "Too complex to set up" version, "My team won't adopt it" version. Each follows the same layout with different objection/response copy.
```

### 10. Thought Leader / Expertise Ad

**When to use:** Long sales cycles, high-trust categories

- **Dimensions:** 1200x1200 (1:1)

- **Color palette / mood:** White or cream background. Black text. One accent color for the speaker's name (DataFlow blue). Feels like a newspaper pull quote or book excerpt.

### Elements
- **Background:** White or cream (#fffdf5).
- **Foreground subject:** The statement text.
- **Text placement:** Statement: upper 60%, left-aligned. Supporting context: below statement. Speaker photo + name: bottom-left.
- **Logo placement:** Extremely subtle. Bottom-right at low opacity. This should feel personal, not branded.
- **Overlays / graphics:** Large decorative quotation mark in light gray behind the statement. Thin horizontal rule separating the statement from the attribution.

### Production Notes
- **Brand constraints:** Speaker must be a real company leader. Photo must be authentic. The ad should feel like an organic LinkedIn post, not a promoted ad.
- **Reference images:** LinkedIn carousel title slides. Harvard Business Review pull quotes. Lenny's Newsletter graphics.
- **What to avoid:** Product screenshots. CTAs that are too salesy. Making it look like an ad (the less it looks like an ad, the better it performs).
- **Variations needed:** Text-only version for X, longer quote version for LinkedIn carousel first slide.

### 11. Interview Ad

**When to use:** Borrowing credibility, community building
**Default visual approach:** Interview-style card with guest photo, name, and a provocative quote.
**Recommended headline formula:** "[Guest name] on [topic]: '[provocative quote].'"
**Typical composition:** Guest photo on one side, quote and context on the other. Podcast/interview aesthetic.

#### Worked Example: Interview Image Ad

```
## Single Image Creative Brief

### Creative Brief
- **Creative type:** Interview
- **Funnel stage:** TOFU to MOFU
- **Platform:** LinkedIn + X
- **Placement:** Feed
- **Dimensions:** 1200x627 (1.91:1 landscape)

### Concept
- **Angle:** Borrow credibility from a respected CMO's take on the biggest time waste in marketing
- **Core message:** A respected CMO says reporting is the biggest time waste in marketing ops.
- **Emotional tone:** Authority, credibility, curiosity ("I want to hear more")

### Copy
- **Headline:** "The biggest time waste in marketing? Reporting. Hands down."
- **Supporting text:** "Maria Torres, CMO at ScaleUp | DataFlow Podcast, Ep. 14"
- **CTA text:** "Watch the full episode →"

### Visual Direction
- **Primary visual:** Guest headshot on left, quote on right. Podcast/interview aesthetic.
- **Composition:** Landscape. Left 35%: guest headshot (professional but warm). Right 65%: quote, attribution, episode info, CTA. Subtle audio waveform graphic at bottom to signal "this is a podcast/interview."
- **Color palette / mood:** Dark background (#1a1a2e or #0f172a). White text for the quote. DataFlow blue accent on the guest's name or episode number. Premium, editorial feel.
- **Typography direction:** Bold sans-serif for the quote. Regular weight for attribution. Monospace for episode number.

### Elements
- **Background:** Dark navy or charcoal.
- **Foreground subject:** Guest headshot (circular crop with subtle border).
- **Text placement:** Quote: right side, center. Attribution: below quote. Episode number: small badge.
- **Logo placement:** DataFlow Podcast logo top-right (or "DataFlow Talks" branding). Platform logos (YouTube, Spotify) at bottom.
- **Overlays / graphics:** Audio waveform graphic along the bottom edge (5% height). Circular photo frame for the guest. "NEW EPISODE" badge if relevant.

### Production Notes
- **Brand constraints:** Guest must approve their photo and quote usage. Real episode, real guest.
- **Reference images:** Podcast promotion cards from Lenny's Podcast, First Round Review, a]6]z podcast graphics.
- **What to avoid:** Low-quality headshots. Quotes that do not stand alone (they must make sense without context). Too much text.
- **Variations needed:** 1:1 for Instagram/Meta feed, audiogram video version, quote card (quote only, no photo).
```

### 12. Lifestyle Ad

**When to use:** Aspiration-led products, B2C or prosumer audiences
**Default visual approach:** Photography-forward. Show the outcome/lifestyle, not the product.
**Recommended headline formula:** Minimal text. "[Outcome] starts here." or text overlay on an aspirational scene.
**Typical composition:** Full-bleed photo with minimal text overlay. The photo does the work.

#### Worked Example: Lifestyle Image Ad

```
## Single Image Creative Brief

### Creative Brief
- **Creative type:** Lifestyle
- **Funnel stage:** TOFU
- **Platform:** Meta (Instagram) + TikTok
- **Placement:** Feed + Stories
- **Dimensions:** 1080x1080 (1:1)

### Concept
- **Angle:** Show what Monday morning looks like when reports are automated. Sell the feeling, not the feature.
- **Core message:** This is what calm, strategic Monday mornings look like when you stop building reports.
- **Emotional tone:** Aspirational, calm, desirable

### Copy
- **Headline:** "Monday morning when your reports build themselves."
- **Supporting text:** None (let the image speak).
- **CTA text:** "DataFlow →" (minimal)

### Visual Direction
- **Primary visual:** A person at a clean desk with coffee, laptop showing a simple dashboard (not zoomed in, background element). Calm, bright, Monday-morning energy.
- **Composition:** Full-bleed photo. Text overlay at top or bottom with semi-transparent background strip. Minimal text. The photo is 90% of the ad.
- **Color palette / mood:** Warm, bright, natural light. Think: "aspirational morning routine." Golden hour or soft daylight. Clean, minimal desk.
- **Typography direction:** Light-weight sans-serif. Small. Text should whisper, not shout.

### Elements
- **Background:** The photograph is the background.
- **Foreground subject:** Person at desk, coffee, laptop with dashboard barely visible.
- **Text placement:** Headline: top 15% with semi-transparent white strip. CTA: bottom-right, small.
- **Logo placement:** Bottom-right, small, white or transparent.
- **Overlays / graphics:** None. The photo carries everything. One semi-transparent text bar at most.

### Production Notes
- **Brand constraints:** Real-looking environment (not a stock photo studio). Natural lighting. Diverse representation. No corporate sterility.
- **Reference images:** Apple product photography. Notion's lifestyle shots. "Day in my life" Instagram aesthetic.
- **What to avoid:** Staged-looking photos. Corporate office stock. Visible product UI in detail (the dashboard should be a background blur). Heavy text overlays that ruin the photo.
- **Variations needed:** 9:16 for Stories (person standing up, walking away from desk), video version (15 seconds of the morning routine).
```

### 13. Memes and Humor Ad

**When to use:** Attention capture, insider audiences, culture-aware brands
**Default visual approach:** Meme format. Recognizable template adapted to your industry.
**Recommended headline formula:** Use the meme format's native structure. Do not over-explain.
**Typical composition:** Follows the meme template (drake format, distracted boyfriend, expanding brain, etc.). Product reference is subtle.

#### Worked Example: Memes and Humor Image Ad

```
## Single Image Creative Brief

### Creative Brief
- **Creative type:** Memes and Humor
- **Funnel stage:** TOFU
- **Platform:** X + Reddit + LinkedIn
- **Placement:** Feed
- **Dimensions:** 1080x1080 (1:1)

### Concept
- **Angle:** Use the "Drake preference" meme format. Top: thing marketers reject (manual reporting). Bottom: thing marketers prefer (automated reporting).
- **Core message:** Manual reporting is the thing everyone hates but keeps doing. There is a better option.
- **Emotional tone:** Self-deprecating humor, insider recognition, shareable

### Copy
- **Headline (top/reject):** "Building a 47-tab spreadsheet every Monday morning"
- **Headline (bottom/prefer):** "Connecting your data once and never building a report again"
- **Supporting text:** "DataFlow. Your Mondays back." (small, bottom)
- **CTA text:** None (memes do not have CTAs, or very subtle)

### Visual Direction
- **Primary visual:** Drake preference meme template. Top panel: Drake dismissing. Bottom panel: Drake approving. Text on the right side of each panel.
- **Composition:** Standard Drake meme layout. Two rows. Left: Drake reaction images. Right: text descriptions. Small brand watermark at bottom.
- **Color palette / mood:** Meme-native. Do not over-design. It should look like something someone made in 2 minutes, not a design team.
- **Typography direction:** Impact font or standard meme font. Black text on white. Do not use the brand's custom font (it ruins the meme feel).

### Elements
- **Background:** White panels (standard meme layout).
- **Foreground subject:** Meme template images + text.
- **Text placement:** Standard meme positions (right side of each panel).
- **Logo placement:** Tiny watermark bottom-right. Almost invisible. Or: "dataflow.io" in small text at the very bottom.
- **Overlays / graphics:** None. Clean meme format. No additional design elements.

### Production Notes
- **Brand constraints:** Humor must land with the target audience (marketers, marketing ops). If you have to explain the joke, it does not work. Stay self-deprecating, never punch down.
- **Reference images:** r/marketing top memes, marketing Twitter meme accounts, tech brand meme ads (Gong, Monday.com humor posts).
- **What to avoid:** Over-designing. Using brand fonts. Adding too much product detail. Forcing a hard CTA. Making the product the joke (it should be the solution to the joke).
- **Variations needed:** "Expectation vs Reality" format, "This meeting could have been an email" format, "Me explaining to my boss why we need DataFlow" format. Each follows a different meme template with the same core message.
```

## Direct-Response Hook Options for Images

Any creative type can use a financial/data hook. These headline formulas from the direct-response approach work especially well in image ads where the number is the visual focal point:

| Formula | Image Headline Example |
|---------|----------------------|
| "The Market Is Paying $X for [Skill]" | "$145K: Average salary for marketers who automate their reporting." |
| "[X]% of [Professionals] Say [Thing]. Only [Y]% Can Prove It." | "87% of marketing teams say they're data-driven. 12% can generate a report in under 5 minutes." |
| "[Professionals] with [Skill] Earn [X]% More." | "Marketing ops professionals earn 34% more than generalists. Automation is the gap." |
| "Companies Hiring [Role] at $[X]." | "$23,400/year: The hidden cost of manual reporting per marketer." |

These work as standalone stat cards (number large and centered, context below) or as headline hooks on any creative type.
