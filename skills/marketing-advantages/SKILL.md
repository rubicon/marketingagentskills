Helps products identify their marketing advantages and develop strategies to leverage them for growth.

## Invocation

Use this skill when the user:
- Wants to identify their product's marketing advantages
- Asks "what are my marketing advantages?"
- Mentions "marketing strategy," "go-to-market advantages," or "competitive advantages"
- Wants to know how to market their product based on its strengths
- Asks about PLG, virality, network effects, or distribution strategies
- Needs help choosing marketing channels based on their product's characteristics

## Framework Overview

Marketing advantages fall into three categories:

| Category | Advantages |
|----------|------------|
| **Product-Led Growth** | Network Effects / Virality, Free Plan or Trial |
| **Market / Ecosystem** | Integrations / Co-Marketing, Channel Partnerships, Wedge Strategy |
| **Brand / Marketing** | Forcing Functions (Trends/Regulations), Community / Educational Content, Founder Story, Category Creation |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Discovery

Ask the user about their product to identify which advantages apply. Use these diagnostic questions:

**Product-Led Growth Signals:**
1. Does your product become more valuable as more people use it? (Network effects)
2. Do users naturally share or invite others? (Virality)
3. Do you have a free plan or trial? What triggers paid conversion?

**Market / Ecosystem Signals:**
4. Do you have integration partners with overlapping audiences?
5. Do other players (agencies, consultants, influencers) sell or recommend your product?
6. Are you starting with a niche to expand to a larger market?

**Brand / Marketing Signals:**
7. Is there a trend or regulation driving urgency to buy?
8. Is your audience underserved by educational content or community?
9. Does your founder have unique credibility or story with this audience?
10. Are you creating or defining a new category?

### Step 2: Identify Advantages

Based on responses, identify which of the 9 advantages apply. Most products have 2-4 primary advantages.

### Step 3: Recommend Strategies & Channels

For each identified advantage, provide the specific strategies and channels from the framework below.

## The 9 Marketing Advantages

### 1. NETWORK EFFECTS OR PRODUCT VIRALITY

**Category:** Product-Led Growth

**Definition:**
- **Virality:** When users share your product internally or externally
- **Network effects:** When a product gains more value as more people use it (stronger than virality alone)

**Strategies & Channels:**

| Strategy | Channels |
|----------|----------|
| Create frictionless onboarding for users to sign up and start using your product | Inbound to acquire free users; website, email, and in-app/product messaging |
| Drive engagement / create champions / power users | Automated emails, in-app/product messaging, community forums, social media |
| Design viral loops to encourage users to invite others (naturally or via referral programs) | Referral programs, social media, automated email |
| Encourage users to make shareable content (UGC) | Automated emails, in-app/product messaging, community forums, social media |
| Create delightful product experiences users want to spread | In-app/product messaging, customer support, social media |
| Make your product unmistakably visible wherever used (email signatures, branded links, branded domains) | Automated emails, social sharing and links |

---

### 2. FREE PLAN OR TRIAL

**Category:** Product-Led Growth

**Definition:** A free version of your product that gets users to unlock value before purchasing. Your product is often easier to market and sell when you have the right "trigger" to paid (time, user count, or feature-based) and when upgrading in-product is easy.

**Strategies & Channels:**

| Strategy | Channels |
|----------|----------|
| Focus on organic & efficient paid inbound to drive free users | SEO, search PPC, paid social, content, social media, email |
| Drive to aha moment quickly | Product demos and webinars, in-app/product messaging, automated emails |
| Market paid product to engaged users | In-product messaging, product tours, lifecycle marketing emails |

---

### 3. WEDGE INTO A LARGER MARKET

**Category:** Market / Ecosystem

**Definition:** When you initially target a small segment to ultimately win a large market. This is only a marketing advantage when the audience in the first market helps you expand to the second and beyond.

**Strategies & Channels:**

| Strategy | Channels |
|----------|----------|
| Make every audience feel like the experience was built for them | Targeted events & emails |
| Test new audiences before product builds for them via paid search and landing pages | Existing communities |
| Use audience 1 to get to future audiences | Audience-targeted paid campaigns |

---

### 4. INTEGRATIONS / CO-MARKETING

**Category:** Market / Ecosystem

**Definition:** When you have partners with overlapping audiences and use the partner as a distribution channel or piggyback on their brand awareness, you can grow faster than building your own audience.

**Strategies & Channels:**

| Strategy | Channels |
|----------|----------|
| Piggyback on reach of partners | Partners' channels |
| Leverage partner's distribution channels | Co-marketing events, podcasts & webinars with partners |
| Market to channel partners & influencers directly | Through channel partners |

---

### 5. CHANNEL PARTNERSHIPS & SALES

**Category:** Market / Ecosystem

**Definition:** When other players in your ecosystem promote or sell your product for revenue share, referral bonus, or buyer discount, you incentivize others to be your marketers and salespeople. Channel partners can be influencers or service providers in your space.

**Strategies & Channels:**

| Strategy | Channels |
|----------|----------|
| Create a simple-to-understand-&-implement way of selling or referring your product | Co-marketing with channel partners |
| Incentivize them to spread the word | Referral program or channel discount |
| Create a simple way for partners to refer/sell your product | Through channel partners |

---

### 6. FORCING FUNCTION: TRENDS OR REGULATIONS

**Category:** Brand / Marketing

**Definition:** When there is a current trend your audience is adapting to or taking advantage of, your audience feels more urgency to buy. If there's a regulation, you create urgency by promising compliance.

**Strategies & Channels:**

| Strategy | Channels |
|----------|----------|
| Create content about the forcing function | Regulation or trend-focused SEO, search PPC, blog posts, webinars and workshops, content & social media |
| Capture existing interest in trend | Outbound email, search PPC, influencers |
| Focus marketing messaging on urgency | Press & events related to trend, push notifications, time-limited offers |

---

### 7. AUDIENCE SEEKS COMMUNITY OR EDUCATIONAL CONTENT

**Category:** Brand / Marketing

**Definition:** When your audience is underserved by educational content or opportunities to connect with each other, you have an opportunity to fill this gap. Build a community and content, then sell them on your product.

**Strategies & Channels:**

| Strategy | Channels |
|----------|----------|
| First, create content & test community events | Use existing communities (SubReddits, Discords, Twitter) to share relevant content and engage with potential community members |
| Build your own community if successful | Your own community (dedicated forum, group chat, Slack, etc.) |
| Market your community like a "product" | Social media, email, influencers |
| Make your community exclusive to foster "tribal affinity" (a movement non-users want to join) | Exclusive community events (meetups, firesides, workshops with high-value community influencers) |

---

### 8. FOUNDER STORY OR FOUNDER/MARKET FIT

**Category:** Brand / Marketing

**Definition:** When your founder already knows the audience well or has a unique ability to speak to your audience, they can become your best "marketer."

**Strategies & Channels:**

| Strategy | Channels |
|----------|----------|
| Build personal brand & channels of founder | PR, podcasts, speaking events for founders |
| Weave founder story into content | Founder's social media |
| Make founder the face of the brand | PR, podcasts, speaking events, founder social media |

---

### 9. ABILITY TO CREATE OR OWN A CATEGORY

**Category:** Brand / Marketing

**Definition:** When your product is an entirely new space or doesn't replace an existing product, you have an opportunity to brand a whole new way of doing something. If your brand becomes synonymous with the category, you have a huge leg up on competition.

**Strategies & Channels:**

| Strategy | Channels |
|----------|----------|
| Create content that educates on pain and problem | Press & analyst relations |
| Repetitive marketing and messaging around category name and definition | Industry events |
| Meet your audience where they are; build templates that work with existing, manual workflows | Thought-leadership content distributed through social |
